I'm happy it worked out for you! :)
I don't want it at all. This is one of the worse ideas I've heard.
"&gt; EDIT: I'm looking through all your overhauls and wondering how you could possibly make them all to this standard since 2011-11-11. You have automation tools for a lot of it, right?

Haha :) Nah, I started making these overhauls back in 2013. The first attempts in making them were horrible, but after a while I got how to make them and the modding process became far more easy for me. Doesn't mean it wasn't time-consuming -&gt; It took indeed a lot of time, especially since most tools like DynDOLOD weren't available back then.

&gt; What major performance drains (enb, foliage etc) were you using for the screenshot I linked?

Vanilla Ice Cream ENB (very performance heavy), some 1k and 2k textures and everything else is included into the Enhanced Landscapes mod.

"This odd little beetle has given me a long runaround. It's certainly not one I'm very familiar with, but your location and these nice closeups are very helpful. I wish I had a fuller dorsal view of the elytra, because what's going on down there might help confirm or deny my very tentative, cautious suggestion as to what this may be.

The best match for this beetle that I can find is *Telephanus atricapillus*, a Silvanid Flat Bark Beetle. It's found in Canada, seems to match in the shape of the pronotum and the appearance of the surface of the elytra, has similar antennae which also seem inclined to point directly forwards, and I certainly don't know of anything that looks remotely as close. 

The source of my doubt: this species generally has blackish markings on the posterior of the elytra. Since I cannot see this one aspect, I don't know if this is present here. Further complicating matters, elytral coloration is variable and there are some specimens which seem to lack nearly any black pigmentation; I can see only perhaps a vague shadow of it if I look very closely. With that in mind, this is my best guess and I hope that someone will come in to secure a more definitive ID. Sorry I'm not oozing with confidence, here.

My sub often does similar things when certain controversial topics come up, because we *will* get attacked to the point where zero discussion can be had until a word is filtered and the people launching the attack give up. there is no conspiracy here, this is standard procedure for most subs, and one that is needed just to keep the sub from de-evolving into a cesspit of spam.

so, to sum it up, mods are in no way obligated to tell you of any hidden rules, filters, or triggers they have set up with automod or internal moderation procedures. there are plenty of reasons for this, and in this case it seems like spam is the most likely one. sure, the word can be relevant, but its much better to remove the comment, review the comment, and approve on a case by case basis instead of assuming the comment will be ok and reviewing it without removing it. that just invites a really, really difficult time keeping things from getting way out of control."

I think most liberals have encountered such at the Thanksgiving table where someone will spout Foxisms or Rushisms; as if they were spells or a chants or normal.

At the end of the day, the GOP has been making this problem for 30 years by perfecting the manipulation of easy to manipulate people but now they've got a tiger by the tail.  They only listen to conservative media and they rally around the GOP the way people rally around sports teams.  In the end, I don't know what can change them but I do know change will have to come from within and what I or my kind say has no effect on that whatsoever.  We're the enemy."

"The best idea is to find out what format your friends/the store is playing. Ideally, you want to build a deck in the format that people are playing because you'll want to play with them. I don't know what your intentions are, if you're going to go to events or not and so forth. If you're playing with only your friends, play what they play, if you're going to play at the store, check out the store/scene and figure out what they're playing. Playing at their Friday Night Magic event is probably a great idea, so buying for that format is likely your best bet.

The two most popular formats are definitely Standard and Modern. Standard is a format that has a smaller card pool, and only the few most recent sets are allowed. The cards also rotate out, which means when new sets come out, old sets leave, so that we don't have too large of a card pool. What this really means for a new player is that every few months, you need to spend money updating decks or building new ones, because cards that made your deck work might not be playable, or other great cards will be printed. Modern, on the other hand, is a non-rotating format. That means that the sets allowed will always be allowed, and any new sets are simply added on top. Standard tends to be a lot cheaper because the cards are newer and easier to get.

Competitive decks in Standard will cost you somewhere between $100-400 depending on which deck you build. Competitive decks in Modern will run you somewhere between $250-$2000. It's not a hard rule, but generally speaking, cheaper decks aren't as good as more expensive decks. I say that with a grain of salt, because the Burn deck in Modern is $700 and one of the top decks. But definitely the cheapest decks are usually not the best, and they're usually being played because they are cheap.

Definitely don't buy booster packs or those 200 card packs. Booster packs generally net you a loss on your investment, so you'll get less money in cards than you pay for the pack. Those 200 packs are probably filled with bulk cards your store couldn't sell, so they do this just as a way to potentially sell them.

The best is to decide what deck you want to play, buy all the cards, and keep playing it. While buying lots of packs could get you a large collection, a lot of cards aren't worth much money, and you would rather have one good deck that can compete with others as opposed to a few mediocre decks that won't perform very well. Don't be afraid to proxy it and test with your friends beforehand, since it's an expensive investment. You can get a Standard and Modern deck with that budget, and have some leftover for accessories or to use as entry fees to tournaments."

"My friend made the game board with a laser cutter, it's pretty sweet. As for physical challenges I'll list off the ones I remember (don't have my rule book with me): moth to flame - All Play - each player puts their hand 12 inches above a stove burner. Every thirty seconds you must lower your hand one inch, last man standing wins. Icy waters - All Play - similar to moth to flame, everyone sticks their hand in an ice bath and the last to remain standing wins. Slap card - single play - someone gets to slap you as hard as they can, no flinching. Fart card - someone farts in your face and you bask in the aroma for 30 seconds. Dragon's Breath - single play - take a shot of hot sauce and keep it down. Inverted Shotgun - single play - chug a beer while your teammate holds you upside down. Grape Gobble - all play -obviously taken directly from the show. I Spy - all play - whoever draws this card names an object and everyone must attempt to find it. First one back with the object wins. Garbage Bag Gladiators - all play - inflate garbage bags then wear them like a sumo suit. You must use your garbage bags to attempt to knock each other off of a couch or some other surface. We also did a bunch of drinking games. So we have Polish horseshoes, Flip Cup, DUI Mario Kart, Beirut, Dizzy Bat, and Slapping the Bag. Those are all all plays. We also got lazy and added some games from Scrubs so Find the Saltine, Macaroni and Toe or Finger is in there as well."

"It's rooted in envy and truth at the same time. The topic is very much simplified in this show, which is to be expected as it is a comedy sitcom. 

If you were to go all overanalytic about it, you could easily argue that Carlton is indeed a spoiled brat that enjoys the fruit of his fathers labour and splurge all the funds on himself while his 'brothers' are broke in the ghetto as they didn't have rich fathers. 

Of course envy is usually at the heart of it. Most people cannot bear to stand other people succeed at a level higher than themselves. It's kind of like how less attractive girls often talk shit about hot girls, it's not that they hate hot girls, it's just that the hot girl reminds them of how much they hate the way they themselves look and then they project that anger. Similarly to the example above, if a hot girl treats the less genetically gifted girls as 'lesser' than herself while basking in the attention and benefits that her attractive physique brings, it can be argued that she's indeed a cunt. Inherited wealth and / or looks is quite similar."

At least Eddie George was built like AP and Fred Jackson is at least 6'1, 220.

"I have often asked myself the same question.  It would be so easy to just self medicate and lose myself......  But....I think I just couldn't see compounding one big problem with more big problems.

"I'll share a little bit about what works for **me**:

When I meet someone, a friend/acquaintance/stranger, I stare **until they look away first**. Thereafter, I'll periodically *look to the sides*, never down.

In this way, I've established dominance without coming off as murderous. Then I allow the other party to feel comfortable by looking away *slightly less often* then they do.

If someone just stares at me, I just stare right back though.

Hope that helps.

"Except no. Do you act 100% within the masculine ideal of your culture? Are you an alpha Chad that lacks any sort of interest that might be deemed ""girly""? How about the masculine ideal of a different culture?

No? That's because gender is a socially constructed idea that was built around the biological fact of sex. Gender is a culturally subjective idea that everyone is brought up in--because it is impossible to fit completely within your cultures masculine/feminine ideal, gender is not absolute, doubly so when you're moving across cultures and ideologies.

Gender is not sex. Gender is the set of rules that a culture has deemed that a member of a certain sex should follow.

"This is the beauty of modern game development and really the secret to why Linux gaming has become a thing: Most games are licensing their engines, which means anything the engine supports is a lot easier for the game to support.

Once the engines support Vulkan API, games will be able to support them. Interestingly, since Vulkan is cross platform and DirectX is not, do you think it's possible that developers will be more likely to flat-out ignore DirectX entirely? Bug hunting for your build against a single graphics API on multiple platforms sounds like it would be less work than multiple platforms with multiple APIs. Sure, the developers don't touch the APIs directly, but the engine does.

Or does it just not work that way? "

"I read all of the tweets that merc nate posted, in his signature wall of text style.  Hsu's sympathizing with Cable because we let Carpenter go and traded Unger, as if the line was any good when they were here before.  He then tries to dispel the notion that Cable has a very strong influence on our OL picks with some garbage about Jarvin Harrison's work ethic.  At this point, Hsu's just trying to make a self-serving argument for himself.  Next, Hsu assumes that Cable has been stripped of his draft influence for a while now because of the Carpenter/Moffit failures.  No evidence whatsoever for that.  Then he goes on to suck on Sweezy, McQuistan, Giacomini and Gilliam's knob, even though the first three can't pass block worth shit and the jury's still out on the last.

*Hsu's tweets in tl;dr form*: ""Carpenter/Moffit picks sucked (**duh**), so I think there's no way PCJS are actually listening to Cable's input and are the primary reason why subsequent OL picks have been similarly terrible.  I'm pretty sure Cable's preferences are actually good, but PCJS are just telling him to fuck off.  Sweezy, McQuistan, and Giacomini are for sure affiliated with Cable and they're great (**they're not**)! I have no hard evidence to support any of this, and am literally just making up a theory that absolves Cable of his failures."""
"This is what I landed on:

* My items are also structures with name, level, 2D, etc. Not sure anyone would disagree that this is the most efficient and database-friendly method. They also have an array of actors.. I labeled *effect actors*. When the item is used, the array is cycled through, and all actors are spawned.

* These *effect actors* are classes of actors that perform just about any task on their spawn, laid out in their *respective blueprints*. Act purely visually, send messages to the player interfaces, or act as a missile. I did this for many reasons, but the biggest was the ""super-clean system"" of isolated effects that I could call when needed. (Whether by an item, an activated skill, or an environmental event.)

* ""How is this relevant to my question?"" Well, this has allowed me to isolate all of the ""weird/unique"" stuff into my effect actors. The mesh, particle effects, weird ""grappling hook"" functionality.

* Working in concert is my ""Health/Damage"" interface used by the character class, with functions such as ""Add HP"" that accounts for stats that might modify the given amount from an effect. Like.. effect actor spawns, calls ""Add HP"" for +100 HP for the player('s target), then destroys itself. The interface checks against the player's ""Resourcefulness"" stat and adds +108 to the HP variable."

One, that's near the end of the patch and you don't get the fun of having your shiny starter with you through all the excitement.

Two, the chance to shinify is very low and there's a waiting/walking requirement between each try so if you are really unlucky you may end up spending the same amount of time trying for a shiny in pokepon that you would if you'd simply reset at the start, only it would be more annoying.

Finally, there's a chance your pokemon will change its nature to something worse and so you may end up with an imperfect shiny you'll feel obligated to use because it's shiny and your starter."

"Did your school not have an exemption policy? In all three colleges I've attended, the rule was that if it was school sanctioned (sports, music events or otherwise scholarship related) the professor couldn't penalize you for absences. "
"I always start with being very clear and simple with explanation. Breaking the formation down into ""this is how we should look on offense"" and ""this is how we should look on defense"" is a must.

For drills I think there aren't many substitutes for skeleton play on a full field. Set up an opposing teams 11 using cones, set your team up, yell out a position (or somehow denote which cone) and have your team go ""pressure"" the selected cone. Pause and make adjustments where needed. Stress proper spacing, have people look around and remember what it looks like from their perspective. Then even challenge a player to, during the pauses, organize their teammates, correct them obviously but get them being vocal.

To work on offensive transitioning do the same thing but have a ball waiting on every cone and on your go, have them play the ball on the pressured cone and go through a scripted passing pattern.
For offensive shape simply go through game realistic (size wise) passing sequences in the shape you'd like them to play.

The other drill that I love focuses more on a flat line of 4 but I use all the time because I just really love it. Set up 4, 15x5 rectangles stacked on each other so it forms a single 15x20 divided into 4 channels. (You can mess with the dimensions depending on preference) You have 2 teams that are split between alternating channels. (4Blue,4Red,4Blue,4Red with 4 players in each channel for instance) The teams goal is to keep possession and then pass to their allied channel THROUGH the opposing teams channel. (Blue passes through Red to the other Blue grid to earn a point). Emphasize the spacing and angles of the defensive line. On the offensive side emphasize quick movement of the ball and creativity.

Hope you're able to decipher these! If you need more explanation let me know. You sound like you know what you're doing so I left these a little open ended. Focus on simplicity and walking through game scenarios, an 11v11 scrimmage where you pause occasionally is also useful."

I had the same problem a month ago. I wasn't able to play for a month, then when I came back I played a normal game as a warmup. I remember clearly, I haven's said anything, we won in 20 minutes, and when the game ended, after 10 minutes, I got a 120 game chat restriction.

I messaged Riot, they only said, that they can't see games where I was toxic, but they can't remove chat restriction now. 

In my opinion, unless they bring back the tribunal, they shouldn't give chat restrictions to anyone. Seriously, how hard it is to launch the Tribunal site and let PEOPLE decide. A bot doesn't see who was the ""bad guy"""

"I should've added that in Original Sin last year it was revealed that Butler (member of the Weapon Plus program) had him mind-wiped and manipulated Wade into killing his parents by arson (without knowing that they were his parents in the house).

He also used a lot of actual school faculty, and shot the film during the regular school year. "
"Nothing's tropeless, but I know what you mean. There is [this](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/buried-treasure/2008-05-01/patlabor-tv-and-oavs):

&gt; As a comedy, Patlabor ranks up with some of anime's best, not for any manic energy but rather for its subtlety. Where most anime (and, in general, Asian) comedies resort to cartoon violence and stupid one-liners for its humor, there was always a little more going on under the hood with Patlabor: a sense of humor based on personalities, on bizarre situations and on irony. [...]

&gt; Truly, what makes Patlabor great is its writing, and its sense of its characters as they go through their day-to-day drudgery. Few anime series, science fiction or otherwise, will devote an entire episode to the show's least socially acceptable character attempting to find a wife (and failing). Fewer still would document the complete destruction of their entire elite brigade of mecha-piloting men in uniform by a rebellious Chinese food delivery boy not feeding them on time. And I can't think of another series that would document the pain caused by piloting a mecha with a toothache.

But I've no idea whether you'd like it."

"Yes, although I wouldn't. I would just get a SIM (if your phone is unlocked to work on the German GSM/UMTS/LTE networks). I also wouldn't get it from T-Mobile.

I would get a SIM from a supermarket or drug store. Get one for Simyo, Blau.de, or any other carrier on the Eplus network. With it, you can get a GB of data for 10 Euros (which will usually be included with the card when you buy it). Eplus doesn't have a very good network, BUT afaik it is still the only carrier that unlocks LTE use for prepaid customers, making it very nice, fast internet at an unbeatable price.

You will need a German-speaking friend possibly with a German credit card to do all the settings for you though, but you sound like you have that. In the alternative, if you are coming to Berlin, I can be that friend if need be. I work right smack in the middle of Potsdamer Platz, so you can pick the SIM up easily from me."

Yes, they're members.


&gt;  I also would ask about Front National, but googling their number of seats: ""2 of the 2,026 seats up for election"" (with 15% of the votes). Why do all European countries have such non-representative ways of dividing seats???


The Front National is also in that group, and the two MPs are shown in the graph. You're right they are absolutely not fairly represented in the French parliament (2 seats on 577, though, not on 2026). That's because of the voting system, which is not proportional but majoritary with two rounds, meaning that all MPs need the majority in their district to get elected. Even when the National Front scores high, people then generally quite massively vote against it in the second round. The system has some logic but I think it would be better to have all parties fairly represented; the current system pushes to a two-party system, which limits people's choice.


Other than France, the UK has an even worst system since voting is majoritary but with only one round, meaning that not only parties are very unfairly represented, but most MPs are *not* backed by a majority and only received around 35% of the votes in their district.


But then as far as I know, all EU countries have a form of proportional representation, so it's not fair to lump all of them together like that. I've heard Germans complain that their treshold to enter parliament is too high (5%), but I think it's pretty reasonable, and it's only bad luck if some parties end up falling under it."

"rural schools. We had 3 buses at my elementary school, and another one that went to the middle and high school in the next town over. So if you went to highschool, you took the bus that gets you to the elmentary school, and then hopped onto the bus that takes you to either the middle or high school. They were about a city block away from each other, so it was more efficient just to have one bus that stopped at both places since there was roughly equal number of kids who went to one or the other. The highschool itself had about 5-6 buses which went to the surronding towns to drop off the kids. If you lived in the town where the middle/highschool were, you were expected to walk or bike to school. "
"In addition to that City Interactive, Keen games (mentioned in the article), down in Langen Limbic Entertainment (ok, not really high profile . . .), Konami and Zynga.

"Wrestling does define a takedown in Folk:

1. TAKEDOWN - T2 - 2 points - Awarded after one of the neutral wrestlers gets behind
the opponent and forces them down to the mat to their stomach or side or knees or
weight on all fours OR takes them directly to their back or buttocks without getting
behind them AND becomes the offensive wrestler. Neutral to Offense is a twopoint
takedown. If you go from neutral to defense, you were taken down. 

It is pretty broad but I prefer it. No matter how you get them down its a takedown. Very rarely are you just getting them down by a luck its a takedown intended for such or winning a scramble and getting top position.


You make a good point for the self defense/ going to the ground in many cases you are right. When I worked in security and while I worried they could pull a weapon I was pretty confident in controlling them and only had a few weird weapon instances. I do see the point when you are totally out of your element and in general its probably safer to throw/push them over and run.

"This is a highly complex issue. The indoctrination coming out of the US is partly to blame as well. Hollywoood has been presenting Black people as completely normal, functioning and moral human beings, when in reality they are on average far more violent, have less impulse control, 19% higher testosterone levels, far less future orientation and at least 15 IQ pints less in the case of African americans and around 30 IQ points less in the case of sub saharan Africans than Europeans. Most people even among our intelectual elites have never even heard of HBD. They know nothing about why Detroit looks like it does. They think that Africans are just as capable of building an advanced civiliation as Europeans or northeast asians are. Europeans live in a high trust society with very low levels of corruption and by far not as much ethnocentrism as you find among more inbred cultures to the south who are all far more tribal genetically(https://jaymans.wordpress.com/2013/09/07/how-inbred-are-europeans/). Our elites and our population is heavily brainwashed with propaganda and has no knowledge about IQ and race differences whatsoever. Every time there is somebody who tries to write about IQ the liberal media dismisses him as a lunatic and most people don´t bother to look into the thinks he´s writing about. I know this from first hand experience. I remeber clearly that i regularly believed the liberal media narrative in their articles about race and never looked into it myself, simply believing that the media wouldn´t lie about race and IQ. I was too trusting until i finally came upon HBD while doing research on the web and started to enlighten myself. Now i always give out HBD sites to REDPILL people.:

"&gt;Gustavo: ""As long as you have children they'll always be your priority, your responsibility. And a man....a man provides.

I dunno how ""red pill"" that really is.  A man's identity rests in providing for a family?  So he's a utility and ATM?  

Surely a man should value himself and be able to find a meaningful role for himself outside the protector/provider role.  Would you say Isaac Newton wasn't a ""real man"" because he didn't start a family?  Even though his mathematical discoveries laid the groundwork for all of our modern technology?"

"More general warnings would be nice. Something like ""intense realistic emergency situations"" would be sufficient in most cases. I don't think anybody can reasonably expect the entire panacea of possible triggers to be covered, but general warnings would be helpful.

For example, l was at /r/nosleep a while back reading stories and they allow the use of trigger warnings in their titles and flair. I read a story that took an abrupt turn from what l thought was about the paranormal into it being about a mom drowning her children. That sent me spiraling into a panic attack. 

I was new to nosleep and didn't really know that they had stuff like that in their stories - most of the stories l had read had been paranormal/supernatural creepy tales or thrillers. I know now that there is a much broader scope, but I would have greatly appreciated of the writer had used the common trigger warning ""violence toward children""."

"&gt;  That's where government intervention comes in. The centralised power of social institutions.


*If it were to pan out that way* I would agree with you.  Except as I've pointed out in the example above, it does not actually work that way.  The capitalist system does not have a social provision.  In fact it doesn't even attempt at equality.  

Also, my example was of the people who have to fend for themselves where society has failed them.  You're defending a system that kills 21,000 per day from starvation.  I am sure that it is the best for you and I who have internet, but I find it hard to believe that this is the best system for a planet.

&gt;  I really don't see how this relates to a historical example of a system better than we have now.

The point that I keep trying to make is ""better for who"" and ""better for what"".  It is arguable that *you* or I may have been born into the right place and for *us* it might be better.  But that hardly proves the point that it is a better system for everyone.  I've also made the point that there is too little history to consider this from an evolutionary perspective.  "

"&gt;  He noted that research has been somewhat politicized, but is “pretty consistent” in showing that children raised with two parents who are married to each other fare better across multiple measures.

This might be true in America, but elsewhere in scandinavia or other countries, its not important at all.  More than likely the discrepancy is caused by fathers being excluded from their childrens lives in america post divorce.

Sadly, because divorce reform goes against the needs of the matriarchy, such progressive reform will never happen.  Instead, politicians will push for more marriages which will not be effective given how bad of a deal that marriage is for modern men.  Policies designed to fail only succeed at wasting money, energy and time."

They knew Brady and NFLPA was going to take to court. They rushed to have it filed in NY. They also know that it could be possible brady wins and gets yet another appeal hearing.

I also purchased some BAC today since it was getting the snot kicked out of it. Housing prices are strong, and I don't think banking is really going to shit the bed so bad that the downside action is THAT warranted.

In both cases, I have plenty of time to be right, and intend for these to be longer term holds."
"Listen, you can talk and say whatever you want with a girl. It all depends HOW you do it and your attitude. 

Here's the short answer and how I talk to girls about it. 
During the conversation:
""yeah i have this autoimmune condition for quite some time now. kinda sucks but hey it could be worse, like cancer.""

If she continues to ask about it, don't apologise, don't get defensive, don't get embarrased. I whipped out my armpit once to show a girl my scar and said ""look at this fucker, it's annoying but I can still lift"".  Explain what it is with confidence, don't make it a big deal, and own it. 

Women respond to confidence. If you're insecure it will become a bigger deal. 

My 2 cents. "

"Good points. But what if exalts did go up in price to 100-200 chaos. The only real difference is that exalting an item is relatively more expensive and getting a multimod etc will be relatively more expensive. Very few people use exalts for their orb purpose, i.e. yolo exalt an item. What we see is changes in demand based on usefulness. Maybe at some point we will see prices adjust more closely, i.e. the inflexibility will loosen up. It sounds like everyone and their entire family used exalts all day long crafting multimods. I doubt many people crafted, and now they suddenly want to craft left and right. What is wrong if if crafting costs a bit more? In the end, what we have seen here the last few days, have shown us that master crafting is indeed a very powerful tool."

"I would check out [The Fat Quarter Shop](http://www.fatquartershop.com) and [Missouri Star Quilt Company](http://www.missouriquiltco.com).  Amazon has ok prices and great shipping (if you have Prime), but I think you'll prefer the selection of either of these places.

Typically, a pattern will tell you what you need for back/binding/batting.  Table runners, placemats, etc may not call for batting at all.

Definitely read the entirety of the pattern before purchasing and cutting.  Take it with you if you find a local quilt shop (LQS) and let them help you.

Also, the charm pack may not have all the patterns on the package, but if you check them out online (like at either place I mentioned), there is usually a thumbnail you can click on that will show all the patterns.

"You're looking at it the wrong way. Being gay is not a medical condition that needs to be treated. Being transgender is. Would you tell a severely depressed person, ""You're fine the way you are! I know you have a chemical imbalance in your brain, but just accept that!"" or would you treat them with an antidepressant to fix that chemical imbalance? Would you tell a young man with low testosterone, ""you're fine the way you are! I know you have a hormonal imbalance in your body, but just accept that!"" or would you treat them for low T?

In a humane world, we don't tell people with medical conditions to ""just accept themselves the way they are."" We treat them. Transgenderism is no different.  And once again, being gay is not a medical condition that needs to be treated like transgenderism is. "

And besides, I never claimed living at home was more expensive. I just said it wasn't as cheap as it may seem. The US government and most companies put the cost of a car commute at $0.575/mi, so at 100 mi/day (M-F), that's about $1200/mo.

"I was a ski patrol for many years and this is pretty scary.  I have seen many injuries from this kind of ""Hey, let's just try going down the hill with no training"" attitude.  Sometimes, I had to call the medflight helicopter and on at least one occasion, I watched someone die.  Sometimes, it isn't the bad new skier, but the person they hit or the skilled skier that swerves to avoid them and hits a tree.  Anyway, ski lessons are a wonderful idea for new skiers.  I used to dread when a school bus would show up and all of these unskilled kids would pile onto the hill.  Usually, one of them got an ambulance ride or the parent drive them to the ER for x-rays."

"No. What I'm saying is: ""You cannot play cards while animations are playing. Since we've already established that the server doesn't know about the animations or their times this is obviously client-side logic. By not allowing you to play cards while your turn is ticking down because the enemy's animations are playing the client de facto partially controls the game flow."" Let me rephrase that. One of the rules of the game is you can't play cards while the enemy's animations are playing. This rule is enforced by the client, not the server. This creates a problem where a client rule and a server rule (turn timer) clash. The solution? Remove the client side rule which is restricting game flow (resolve card effects immediately and allow us to play cards while the animations are playing)."

"Man, you just sent me on a interesting trip through wikipedia. The record of Britain's attempted first contact in 1880 was particularly of note. As was their policy at the time, they went on the island to kidnap a couple of people, hold them for a couple of days, and release them with gifts back to their people. They grabbed four children and an elderly couple. The elderly couple died of disease, and they later released the four children back with gifts (who promptly ran back into the jungle and vanished).

Now, obviously to modern ears, that is a particularly distressing way of making first contact with a people. But it does remind me of the sort of stories people tell about alien abductions.

"The ceremony part of the marriage was started in the late 1800s, early 1900s, by a committee of Gurdwara leaders (long after the death of the tenth Guru). Before that couples would go pray at the Gurdwara, then go home and party. 

The Anand Karaj ceremony was added (for arguable reasons) but it apes the Hindu ceremony of going around a fire 7 times and instead the couple goes around the 11th Guru (our holy book) 4 times as 4 different hymns regarding marriage are sung.

Those hymns, while being written by the 4/5th Guru, talk about the marriage of a human soul to God's will, and the duty we have to God. Instead some people today take it as the duty of a wife towards a husband, taking an ethos that was progressive centuries ago and moving it backwards."

So it is inaccurate for Clinton to say that she has always thought that marriage should be left up to the states, and to imply that it was just a matter for the states while she was a senator. Also notice how she elides the fact that she ran for president of the United States in 2008, openly opposing same-sex marriage.

"Different countries use different but overlapping GSM bands.  What bands your device supports depends on each variation of which device you buy.  A little research will get to the device you want with the bands you need for your usage profile.

I'm using the International Note 4 SM-N910F because it supports almost all GSM bands because I actually need them (since I travel internationally often.)  If you live in Country X and never really leave then you can buy a phone that only has bands used there and be just fine.

I understand that horror is a divisive genre and some people can't stand it, but if one doesn't like a single one of the titles I mentioned above, I think they're just prejudiced.

"1900mmr in hon not bad

The laning meta for dota has always kinda been the same, with the one big change about a year+ ago when the creep equilibrium got changed to meet closer to the offlane tier 1 tower (meaning a lot more offlaners could safely get exp).  Trilane vs trilane is not very popular anymore as a result, and most supports focus on stacking jungle for mid/carry and smoke ganking mid.  Heroes that can clear big stacks are especially popular right now: SF, lina, leshrac, storm, gyro, antimage.  

2/1/2 is still popular in pubs due to all-pick lineups being trashy with no synergy, so it's better to just get exp on everyone.  Jungle is not as popular anymore due to the popularity of counterpicking bounty hunter and just fucking with the jungler for the first 15 mins (it also means no stacks for mid if your mid falls behind)."
"Yea. I think I got master conjuration+restoration robes (cleared Fellglow keep, not counting Invisible Bullshitties - got robes by sneaking). Other than that, maybe some magicka ring."
"Just to give some possible ideas, I used to have a setup that led to a close 50/50 in SFxT if they didn't roll out of it with a similar premise.

It was off some hard KD, and then frame killed crouch jab, crouch medium kick, into a headstomp safejump (against some of the cast). What the first headstomp would do is float you high enough where you can cross up with j.LK or fake the cross up and hit with j.HK in front.

I don't think the reset or idea has any merit because of the fact that you need that third stomp to hit without your opponent figuring out what's happening, but you might want to experiment with your options post first stomp and go from there.

I say this mainly because her new j.HP is no longer her target combo, but nj.HP version which is a better hitbox. So you can possibly do stuff like go empty low, headstomp overhead into double overhead, or even mess with the timing to go headstomp single hit of j.HP to mix up your opponent if they aren't use to the timing."

And I don't even want to start talking about how Carabineros and the Army have a separate pension system that doesn't have any of the problems that 75% of Chile will face when they get to old age.

The reason I bring this up is because (as mentioned in the above book) it could be she has a hard time when things don't go as she expects them to.  Not because she is being stubborn or purposely obstinate but things aren't turning out how she thought they would and she doesn't have the emotional/verbal skills to express that.  Watch her for a few days, keep a journal and see what is really making her loose it.   Is she tired? Hungry?  Is the situation not what she expected?  Find her triggers.   (those are my son's biggest triggers but may not be your daughters).

"Not a parent, but I work with kids. Disciplining seems to work better if you don't raise your voice. State the fact: what you did was shitty. Hand down a punishment, and then act like a brick wall. Fear can be a powerful tool, but setting an example of calm resolve is even more powerful. 

A good example is when you assemble kids to talk to them and they won't stop talking. So many people yell, or get mad at them, and it works sometimes. But other times it sends the message that your frustrated, and kids understand that frustration indicates a lack of control. So, they keep talking and now you've got to be even meaner so you don't appear to be backsliding, but since you can't actually use physical violence, every time they keep talking, you just have to up the ante again. If you keep cool and ask one more time, they'll ignore you again. Then you let them keep going, while you stare at them. They might keep talking in the group for ten, maybe 20 minutes, but eventually some are going resent the others because they want to do something else. This is a powerful tool.

That all being said, in a youth development setting, there's always a big bad guy up at the top who will do the yelling for you.

I guess I'm trying to restore it's aggressive stance.   Basically I got shrockworks front bumper with winch and PIAA lamps, i have rigid lighting all over gobi rack with ladder (hi lift jack and awning mounted on opposite sides), rock sliders, and shrockworks rear bumper with rear mounted spare and jerry can holder.

This was all installed after the 3 inch lift and I think it's caused it to sag a bit (maybe half inch).   

Taking it to slee automotive in Colorado (Toyota specific) and they recommend stronger coils, and some other goodies, but I'm curious what would be most beneficial off-road in restoring it's very aggressive posture.

I sent that to the garage consultant, and he said that's lifted more than 3 inches, so now I'm looking for tires to give a bit more height to the vehicle, if that makes sense.   Unless I'm missing something or a complete idiot, I'm thinking the tires is where I should be focusing"

"I will tell you of the bard I am currently playing.  He's a conman.  We're running HotDQ, and part of his goal in Baulder's Gate is to try and raise the local militia to harass or help attack the cultist.   So he's using his charlatan background to pose as a far off noble, seeking help in hurting the cult here to weaken their positions in his home country.  Those who aid him here will get cuts of mineral and other rights out there, at least that's what they get told.  Of course, he's creating the greatest challenge to himself by disguising as a cultist to intimidate anyone who listens to him too seriously.  The goal is to create a sense of fear around the cult so that others will burst into action.  At some point, he's going to have to ""kill"" his cult persona and have the paladin take the credit for it to give everyone a rally point against the cultist.

In combat, I play him as a near pacifist, since hypnotic pattern and fear and all those sorts of ""I don't want to deal with you, go away now"" spells are his go-to, but he can be downright ruthless otherwise.  There's a new standing rule that I need someone in the party to be there to supervise when I interrogate anything.

Yes he does get a lot of ""You should be singing and playing your instrument."" crap, to which I have to remind everyone I'm not that kind of bard."

"Cube world isn't your typical game either. It's developed by only 2 people. It took a long time from the time it was teased until we got an alpha. I don't even remember how much I paid for the alpha but you can sure as hell bet that I got my money's worth. If he doesn't update it, oh well. If he does update it, sweet, the update is free! It's not like he charged $60 for a completely unplayable game (looking at you 343, cough MCC)

The thing you have to remember is big game dev companies are paying their employees even before they sell the games. They NEED to make that revenue back and get ROI as soon as possible. Take Sledgehammer Games for instance. Wikipedia reports that they have 225 employees. Let's say 10% of them are developers. (a very underestimated amount seeing as they are a game DEVELOPMENT company) let's assume the base salary for one of their developers is a modest $60,000 a year. Multiply that number by 22 and you get $1.32 MILLION. This is yearly expense just for your developers. 

It STILL takes a lot of the companies that develop Call of Duty games 2+ years from their previous release to release another installment. And this is with the 11 times (at least) more developers than Cube World has. The first alpha build of Cube World was released only 2 years ago.   How about we stop giving this guy so much grief and let him develop HIS damn game? 

Keep up the good work Wollay, and if you do end up releasing a beta, you can sure as hell bet that I will play it and give feedback.

TL;DR You paid to be able to play HIS game early. Sure it's not the typical way game dev works but who cares? He isn't on a time crunch like big game dev companies with high overhead. The Dev process takes a long time especially with 2 people.

"So you're theory is that the FEV mostly being released due to Chinese nuke strikes, and that the Chinese targeting important Enclave locations was the main cause of the demise of the Enclave?  While this is possible, I don't think it undermines the Enclave's plan all that much.  They wanted to have an army of super mutants, they wanted to have an army of deathclaws, and they wanted their modified version of the FEV to be released and kill off the remaining US population.  It almost seems to me like the Chinese just helped them do what they eventually planned on doing anyway.  From what I've read on the subject and from playing Fallout 3, the Enclave still has FEV at their disposal.  IIRC, they wanted you to poison Project Purity with FEV.

I think the main reason that the Enclave is in the position that they are now is because of the main characters in the Fallout series. 

Don't get me wrong, I think most of your theory is spot on.  The Chinese had spies all over the US, so them knowing all of the Enclave's secret locations is not a stretch at all.  I just don't think that the Chinese targeting important Enclave locations and releasing the FEV is the main cause of the Enclave's demise."

"A small update on this: after having tried numerous solutions and having noticed that both the importxml() and importhtml() functions have stopped working for sfstat.info, the issue is probably not coming from within the tool itself but rather from Google or Cloudflare (the host of sfstat.info). It might therefore take me a bit longer than expected to solve this issue; I'm unfortunately unable to give an accurate time estimate. Once it's fixed though, I'll update everyone in this thread. "

"This comes from 10 years ago, but I probably spent $150 on personal food, toiletries and food for my livestock every month. You could get fancy street food in the capital for about $1. If you went to the nicer ex-pat restaurants in country it could set you back $15, which felt exorbitant at the time. Beer cost about $1. But that was in one of the ""least developed"" countries in the world so cost of living was pretty cheap. I often splurged on food when I visited the capital and could breeze through my monthly allowance if I stayed too long.  I spent about $2 for the 2 hour ride to the capital. 

I did not pay rent and I had no utilities. At the weekly market I would buy tomato paste, pasta, bread, sometimes eggs depending on the season, onions and any veggies I could scrounge up. I bought a 50 cent bag of beignets for my favorite village kids to share and another bag for myself (so good). 

My goats cost $5-10 and my camel cost $175 and I saved up for them. :-)"

"When I built my bike I'd say it took me about 6-8 hours from start to finish. 

Building a bike is not difficult at all. Mechanically, the stuff you will be touching is very simple, everything just bolts on. Adjusting it once it's together is more difficult. 

The issue is having the special tools to install the bottom bracket, install the headset, etc. If you are willing to buy the tools, you can put a bike together in a day. "

"He's definitely not a scrub, but I think JV has a higher ceiling than TT. What do you think?"
"&gt; The blue argument is due to the influx of people from blue States. Austin is a big technology hub drawing from Silicon Valley and other areas of the west coast.

I don't think Austin alone can turn Texas blue. Also, the other metropolitan areas in Texas aren't focused around tech, a sector that naturally attracts socially progressive people.

Dallas has AT&amp;T and Texas Instruments, but the economy in the Metroplex is mostly defense, manufacturing, healthcare and finance. Lockheed Martin, Bell Helicopter, Southwest Airlines, Frito Lay, ExxonMobil (soon moving to the Woodlands), etc. Silicon Prairie is mostly corporate/enterprise tech; not as many agile, hip startups as in Austin.

Houston of course has accrued its wealth through oil; and previously through cotton. (In fact, KPRC Local 2's call letters mean ""Kotton Port Rail Center"".) Power players in Houston include ExxonMobil, Phillipps 66, Shell, BP, ConocoPhillips, Chevron, BHP Billiton, Aon Hewitt, Halliburton, Sysco and so on.

San Antonio has USAA, Valero, a Toyota plant, Clear Channel and Tesoro.

Outside of Austin, I don't think the economic power players of major Texas cities necessarily acquit themselves in a way that can attract young, progressive workers, who would trade a white picket fence, 2.4 kids and church potlucks for some decent public transportation, workers' rights and statutory protection of racial, sexual and religious minorities (such protections are strong in CA, WA, OR, CO, MA, IL, MD, PA...states where high tech is booming). 

When Rick Perry says Texas leads in job creation, he neglects to mention that most of these jobs are low-wage entry-level jobs with no benefits. Meanwhile in northern states, a significant portion of jobs added are high value-adding jobs. I wouldn't be surprised if most of the jobs added, besides oilman jobs which are dependent on the price of crude staying above $70/bbl, are just crew positions at Whataburger or the like, paid at $7/hour with no health insurance at all.

&gt; Pockets of Texas are very blue but many who are native Texans, much of the Hispanic population, have that Texan rugged individualism. They don't want the Government in their business so there is a portion that vote red.

This is an interesting point. I'm Canadian, and ever since the first settlers came here in the 17th century, people have had to band together to get through the cold winters. Our social safety net is strong
because of that underlying mentality of ""we're all in this together"". However, in the US, the pioneer spirit and American heroes like John Wayne taught people that they had to pull themselves up by their own bootstraps without outside help. Once the Cold War began, it suddenly became ""If I could pull myself up, why should I give away my hard-earned money? He's just lazy!"" and the American social welfare system has been suffering for 70 years because of that.

&gt;  Take the most recent election for the Governor. Wendy Davis based her whole campaign on abortion and got slaughtered.

Why does the Democratic Party suck so much in Texas? I don't understand why they're not getting their ass in gear. And now the end result is Dan Patrick is the most powerful man in Texas. This is probably the closest an American state can get to an equivalent of ISIS taking over Ramadi."

"No official policy on it and with how convulted the funding is, it's sometimes necessary to see it as a illness, though not often.

"To play devil's advocate, most of the black people in Canada are recent immigrants from Africa and the Caribbean.

"That's quite a fallacy there. There's a huge difference between doing something dangerous that modern society hinges on us doing and doing something dangerous for literally no reason other than being ignorant. If we didn't have to drive it'd be a great achievement. Self driving cars could save millions of life. We as a society agree to accept the risks of driving to live the lives we live though. We as a society do not agree to suffer from preventable diseases because some parent thinks they know more then essentially a whole scientific establishment. Anti vaxxers/ pro choice vaxxers are very vocal but still a minority. Unfortunately a minority that can kill others. "

"This is incredibly important.  I believe Hillary Clinton was plenty smart enough to know that the case for Iraqi WMDs was bullshit.  If nothing else, Saddam Hussein was a survivor, and he would not risk his own life just to pursue an old fantasy about doomsday weapons.  Yet every other serious analysis also lined up with the ""no active WMD program"" conclusion.  Faced with actual armed forces massing near his territory, Saddam Hussein even allowed unfettered inspections -- inspections that left no doubt in the minds of any serious and honest observers.

Yet Hillary Clinton isn't just someone who might be smart enough to understand an intelligence report.  She is also someone easily moved by the winds of public opinion, however misguided or fleeting that sentiment might be.  She was in the perfect position to rise up and show leadership, rallying the opposition to at least try and stop the pending slaughter.  Instead she weakly voiced reservations, then fully supported the war effort.

I'm glad she reserved the ability to conduct international relations with some discretion regarding her own e-mail.  I don't think she was even slightly at fault for the tragic events in Benghazi.  However, she certainly shares a measure of the blame for the Iraq war.  Literally no one else was in a better position to resist the push toward unprovoked invasion, yet the alpha and omega of her resistance was to append ""assuming the administration is telling the truth"" to her downright murderous votes.  It is no wonder that she lacks the integrity to stake out positions on issues like the Iran deal or the TPP even today!"
"I've seen dozens of Packers worse than Jones. He was fine for most of his career.

"I'm a law student in South Carolina but I'm from Hershey and registered there as a democrat. As a fellow Pennsyltuckian who knows what's going on up there, do you think my primary vote would be better served in PA or SC?"
"I can clearly see the differences too. The reds, to me, get shifted to a more muddy brown or grayish olive rather than a green. The greens just get a little more washed out, turned more into a brownish grey or  closer to a yellow. The changes in pinks, purples, reds, and oranges are definitely the most noticeable to me, as well as the blue-greens. 

I often find that my perception of the change, though most often quite significant, is not as astounding as those with normal color vision. Guess this means that how I see things can't be experienced or explained any more than me experiencing how normal color vision sees things. "

"There have been 3 or 4 cases I've seen/heard about. It's not really ""plenty"", but it does seem to happen.

Here's one example: this guy said pre-patch he was rank 1 with ~1574 mmr on hotslogs. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/3hlvdb/placement_matches_and_rank_before_and_after/cu8t9ck

After his placement matches though, he got put at rank 48. I don't think he's lying either.

I suspect people like this may be part of why Blizzard reset ranks.

It's not that ranks are randomly distributed with no correlation to MMR- there is definitely a trend where higher rank = higher MMR, but there are a few very weird looking outliers like that guy. Here's an example graph someone made: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10LjD9PPv91SSqWPyAu2jRG-JpdnTcke5n2xL6zt1-SQ/pubchart?oid=140011512&amp;format=image

It's purely by user submitted data though, so some of the points could be garbage. Also, anyone *above* the trendline (like the 3.6k MMR rank 18 guy) would probably just be people who haven't yet played more than a few hero league games, but won most of what they played. This was *before* the placement match reset."
"OP will probably want to partner with a small independent publisher (perhaps, say, the sort that also do rebinding) -- ideally one who holds the same value of passing the lowest cost possible to the consumer. So I think I'd start first networking among various Stoic sites, listservs, forums, Google Groups, societies, whatever can be found -- and probe around to see if anyone out there bites. "
And they most likely were going to revive him later.
Slow clap.
"I agree, however just because there are a few doesn't mean it's worth it in a business sense. Case in point is Xenoblade. That lost Nintendo money. It was the most outspoken title for them to bring over to the states, and it wasn't even worth it for them, and that's just a localization. Imagine a port, having to rewrite some code and so on. 

They would have to Guage consumer interest like I said. They also need to balance their other projects, and see if they'd rather make something new, or port something old. Half the reason they did DS2 was because it launched originally when the new systems were available, so a lot of people wondered why they weren't available in the first place. "
"I don't know where you are located but Its not unusual for florists to travel 1/2 hour.  I'd continue searching within a 1 hour radius of your venue.  Where I am florists have to drive 1.5-2 hours just to make their wholesale floral purchases. "

"Buying a house now, and shopped lenders.  The lowest closing cost estimate we got was for ~8k.  As /u/wamazing mentioned, a big portion of that is prepaying property taxes (~3k), insurance, etc... The number your father mentions doesn't strike me as outrageous."

"And this is precisely why Greece is in the situation it's in I suppose. There seems to be a universal lack of self-reflection in Greece. I visited on a road trip...It reminded me of a 3rd world country in some ways. 

If your businesses don't have access to capital to purchase inventory, and your unemployment rate is 30%, all the while the islands enjoy a 6% VAT while the rest enjoy the standard 20%, ....

I can go on and on...The massively bloated public sector, the barriers to entry for professionals....All of this shit is self-made. Did the Germans exploit an already really bad situation? Im certain they did. But why greece is spending any money on military while the country implodes is....well, exactly what I would expect at this point.

Switzerland is the fourth highest gun ownership rate in the world and the 11th lowest murder rate. "
"Italy don't get near enough flak for all the problems they've caused, though do they?

"Perhaps not in those conditions, but the record for a human running a 1000 mile race is 10 days 10 hours 30 minutes 36 seconds. It's fast enough that his time would have taken first in every single Iditarod before 1995. Ultramarathoning is a comparatively tiny, tiny sport as well with most of these races having fewer than 5 competitors.

A human in human-ideal conditions is in the same ballpark as a husky in husky-ideal conditions. There are certainly big differences, but it's not inconceivable that if ultramarathoning gains in popularity, we'll see some human 1000 mile times that beat husky times.

EDIT: corrected time and added detail"

"This is about par the course.  I've started leveling a tank on a new server to play with friends after sitting at max and having plenty of the nice dungeon drops to use on new classes, and ooooh man, starting out with quest gear again is TOUGH.

* animals (as opposed to humans, that is)

The drawers are hardwood, but they are just stapled not dove tail. The doors are a wood veneer center panel. The only problem you will have is the limited sizes avalable. If the sizes work then these are a good affordable option. They do run 20% off quite often so dont buy till then. This line is also in there design program so they can do a 3d layout for you. "

"Ei niitä kokonaan tarvitse vapauttaa. Sehän on jotain anarkiaa. Tässä ois kompromissi jolla Suomen työllisyysaste roketoisi:

- Annetaan yritysten ja työntekijöiden sopia palkoista enemmän keskenään. Riittäköön jonkinlainen minimipalkan käsite alalle (joka on oikeasti todella minimi) -&gt; Ikäsyrjintä vähenee ja tasavertaisuus työpaikoilla lisääntyy, koska ei tarvitse väkisin maksaa huonommalle työntekijälle suurempaa palkkaa, vain koska se on istunut jossain tuolissa 5 vuotta.
- Lopetetaan yrityksen vastuu työntekijän työkyvyttömyyseläkkeestä ja rahoitetaan se yhteisistä varoista -&gt; Ikäsyrjintä vähenee
- Irtisanominen alle 100 hengen yrityksissä helpoksi ja takaisinottovelvollisuudet pois -&gt; yritykset uskaltavat kokeilla enemmän ja useampi työllistyy. Nyt uuden rekryn pitää hipoa täydellisyyttä, jotta mahdollisimman pieni todennäköisyys epäonnistumisille -&gt; Monia paikkoja hankala edes täyttää.
- Ansiosidonnainen kaikille, mutta hieman matalampana. Tämä olisi todella vasemmistolaista, mutta siihen ei ay-siat suostu. -&gt; Elintasoanskuttajat eivät jää niin helposti kotiin. Koskee erityisesti kaikenlaisia koti-insinöörejä joille olisi töitä, mutta kun on kivaa leikkiä lasten kanssa 2 vuotta ja antaa muiden maksaa. 
- Laitetaan yrittäjä ja työntekijä jokseenkin samaan asemaan turvaverkkojen suhteen -&gt; Yrityksiä ja innovaatiota syntyy enemmän koska et saa kenkää niin helposti turvaverkoista jos perustat yrityksen. Yrittäjä on nykyisin useammin duunarin näköinen kuin joku ihme taistolaisfantasian silinterisika. Sika on nykyisin AY:ssa.
- Rajataan yrityksen vastuuta sairaslomista vaikkapa 4 viikkoon kaikkialla ja laitetaan 1 karenssipäivä -&gt; Rekryn riski laskee taas, enemmän työllistyy.
- Leikataan nykyisiä maksussa olevia eläkkeitä yläpäästä painottaen ja rikotaan eläkelupaukset, niin ei tarvi sitä TyELIä nostaa 30 pinnaan lähivuosina. Vähä haistavittu-move, mutta joskus on pakko.
- Homma vois visualisoida siten että kaikista TES-papruista pitäs lähteä puolet sivuista nuotiolle.

Työläinen olisi varmaan onnellisempi kun ei voisi jäädä paskaan duuniin hikoilemaan vuosiksi vain koska kaikki lait tekee irtisanomisen hankalammaksi kuin paskan yhteistyön kestämisen.

En usko että mikään näistä kelpaa koskaan AY-sioille -&gt; tuho.

Karu esimerkki Suomesta tapahtui juuri asiakkaalla: He tekivät talvella 2015 rekryn heti kun saivat tiedon että syksyllä 2014 irtisanotut olivat työllistyneet. Firma menetti muutaman kuukauden tuotot työstä, mutta se oli halvempaa kuin ottaa epäsopiva takas tai maksaa kiristysmaksut. Kaikki hävisivät - aivan kaikki. Ei näin. Tän pitää loppua."

"Intended mechanic or not, there was never any point where people had to do the fight that way simply because both healers had plenty of ways around it. Which makes AST comparatively very poorly suited for the encounter. If a new fight were coming out, SE surely wouldn't implement something of that nature, where one healer is at a severe disadvantage for a certain mechanic. But, as far as a couple mechanics from old, completely irrelevant content, they didn't care. So, old mechanics from irrelevant content aren't really a great reason for why SE wouldn't add a certain job. If we're talking about a new job, released with an expansion, alongside a level cap increase, only mechanics from that point forward are really relevant to the job in question when it comes to encounter and job design.

If they restrict themselves by strictly balancing new jobs around old, irrelevant content from one or two expansions ago, rather than focusing on balancing them around the current content and the kind of future content they would like to release, the job and encounter design in the game are going to have much less creative room to grow and improve."

"The hue starter kit includes the hue hub which uses the Zigbee lighting HA protocol and it will control the brightness of the GE Link bulbs and the Cree smart bulbs as well. However if you plan to just use a smartphone to control the bulbs everything will work great but speaking from experience it gets old having to use phone to adjust something a wall switch can do much quicker. 
I control all my smart bulbs via an ISY994 using the Hue API which is real easy to do. With some motion sensors and basic logic you can get away with having the ""smart"" home do what the phone app does but much quicker. For example my hue bulbs come on in a low red light during the night if I get up to use bathroom so they dont blind me or wake up my SO. I also have a sunrise program I run that slowly brings the lights on starting at a deep red color and eventually getting to a bright yellow to simulate a sunrise that happens an hour after I wake up (really helps wake up for day if you rise before the real sun). 
The basic point I want to make is make the products do all the dirty work, plan and program it to work for you instead of making something as simple as lights a chore to use. This is a basic part of HA that I feel a lot of people overlook. "

"Congrats on the 50th star!  I asked your question to an ebay rep about 6 months ago because I too was curious. They said 10-13% was the norm (I do not sell electronics). I don't know how this was quantified but thought I'd share. I echo the posts that refer to sales as a volume issue. The more I list, the more I sell. I also noticed an increase in sales when I have diverse merchandise.  Consider expanding your sale market to increase conversion. I opened my sales to GPS (very little action) and Canada (direct through USPS).  Sales to Canada have averaged 3% of sales during the past three months. I double list some items on ebay and Amazon. You just need to stay on top of pulling the item from one platform when it sells. Good luck reaching your next 50! "

"There is actually a question of it, if you're willing to actually open your mind to something that isn't a predetermined narrative. Not all animals can sustain large populations. It's simply a fact and a matter of resources.

Seals DO come to land and polar bears could hunt closer seals and do. I'm sure that the amount of ice shrinking is a factor, but there would be more locally available food if there were more seals too, meaning the bears wouldn't have to take such large risks to find more food. Plus polar bears do eat other things. 

The climate IS changing, the ice IS melting, but that's also sent polar bears further south than usual, where other species of bears can and do live. If polar bears can't adapt to changing climates, then they're doomed anyway since the Earth has been getting warmer since the ice age. That's whole reason there is no longer an ice age. The speed is obviously an issue, but maybe apex predators just aren't going to thrive in a world with humans in it. Seems to be the general trend right now, which is fine by me since I generally don't like the thought of being eaten.

There are species that adapt fast and can acclimate to new environments quickly and they do fine. If polar bears are going to go the panda route, sucks for them, but there's not much we can do. And believe it or not, not everybody believes that it's humanity's duty to preserve nature. I for one, think that nature will do whatever the fuck it's going to do regardless of what one species of animal thinks."

The point at which the Qur'an was revealed is intended to only contain information that applies to humanity until the end of time."

"Edderion nodded along as Rogar spoke of Alicent and Roose - a peculiar match, what with their houses being so far distant from one another, but nothing strange. When he mentioned wedding Arya to Alesander, however, his eyebrows shot up.

""Arya and the King? Now that's a strange match. I see little benefit from it for Alesander, save, of course, a beautiful wife. An odd choice.""

And the choices got odder as they went. *Perceon and Lyarra?* Edderion resisted the urge to laugh outright. Sure, there was nothing exactly *wrong* with the Redwynes, but the matches seemed to be reversed. The Master of Ships offered his king the hand of a daughter of a secondary house in a different kingdom, and sought to claim that kingdom's princess for his own kin. 

""I see little benefit in wedding my sister to Perceon."" Edderion told Rogar. ""Unless his father is willing to part with a huge portion of his navy as a...*gift*, to his new kinsmen. But then, with the fleet in hand, what need have I for his son? In any case you have the right of it; I have no plans to marry her off until she's - not healed, perhaps, but *better*, and when Arrana has a match made, as well. Though perhaps that last custom may be circumvented - Ana has shown no signs of wedding any time soon.""

""And as for Raya and Robert...its a better match, but as you say, provides far too much of a claim to our throne, I think. And why the raging desire for women of the North? What happened to the old whispers of *savages* and *barbarians* - two of my four kingdoms worship the southern gods, but I've heard no word of matches with Tullys or Arryns or Freys. Perhaps the Old Gods are the new fashion of the day. Whatever the case I find myself unconvinced. In times of war Lord Redwyne would be our primary foe on the western sea - and I'd not have my sister trapped upon his island, unless he were willing to give me means enough to win her back, if needed.""

"/u/quickonthedrawl in /r/fantasyfootball makes guides for which defense to play each week

streaming is when you play a different defense each week - the theory is that defense scoring is waaay more reliant on matchups than any other position. RBs will always run well but even the seahawks will get lit up by a great offense.

https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/2q6t4n/week_17_dst_scoring_2014/

https://empeopled.com/p/28403

so this dude ranks which defense you should pick up each week, its helped me a lot the past two years since i dont have to reach for a top tier D in the draft and instead i pick up a sleeper in those later rounds. obviously teams like the seahawks and lions will usually be up near the top but you can get some awesome value from streaming.

and the 2nd qb ive always found to be a little useless. QBs get hurt less often, and usually you can pick up a mid-tier dude at any point in the season so i like rostering another wr/rb instead of the qb who ill probably use only on the bye week "

"While I can see while a Jefferson Davis statue can easily be seen as a glorification of the Civil War and Davis himself was bigoted, racist asshole...

You should look into the history of that plaza and why the statues were erected in the first place. It wasn't as a glorification of the war. It was to highlight how the wounds of the Civil War had been healed by WWI. It was erected prior to the rise of the Dixiecrats and no one involved in the project had ties to the typical groups going around throwing up glorification monuments. 

Does that mean the statue belongs there?  No, it doesnt. It's out of place with modern culture and it's removal may very be the appropriate thing to do (I'm perfectly fine it myself).

But you're revising of the history behind the entire exhibit is exactly what people are upset about. You already don't grasp the nuances of the situation and eagerly whitewash over the past to fit your new viewpoint. That rewriting of history is what people are concerned about when they say they want to keep it. Because people will forget it's true purpose and fit it to whatever cause they wish, and those who forget the past are doomed to repeat it. 

Get rid of it if you like, but know more about it before throwing your chips on the table. "

"&gt;  men are allowed to introduce the same ""evidence"" as women.

Yet evidence from men is not carried in the same weight. From a political perspective, I strongly doubt a judge who favors women is going to get loads of backlash. He or she will be cited as progressive and feminist. Critics of he/she would be misogynist.

&gt; think it happens a lot in a custody battle that women get someone to punch them in the eye and blame it on the husband?

No. I have not commented on how often this happens. All I have said is that it's very possible. And I've come across men who have been very burned.

&gt; That doesn't mean at all that that testimony makes the day or decides the case.

No one testimony alone doesn't make a case. But which testimonies tend to be valued more? Mom being abused by a violent husband? Or an innocent man falsely accused of violence? 

&gt;The rules of evidence don't apply the way they would in civil or criminal litigation. That means hearsay is permitted, testimony outside a courtroom or not under oath is permitted, and generally, anything you want to put in front of a judge/testify to is allowed. But it works both ways, men are allowed to introduce the same ""evidence"" as women.


This is my point. There is a huge moral hazard here. Especially when you consider that hearsay from women carries more weight that hearsay from men.


1. Huge argument
2. Call police, ""my husband is abusing me""
3. Husband automatically arrested
4. Later cite arrest at trial

I'm not saying this always happens. I'm just saying that it's very possible and this is shocking.

In this case we don't actually know if he has been told point blank he has no other options. He can cheat, he can masturbate, which he is doing, he can go to a prostitute (more cheating but possibly more palateable) or and this is the important bit...he can have daily sex with his wife as long as he can adjust to quickies and to at least initiating.

"My asshole uncle told me once that my dad had a ""big surprise"" for me. Yeah, turns out the ""surprise"" was a god damn antelope stampede which was all a ruse to kill my dad and usurp his throne. That was a dick move enough, especially against dad, but then he led me to believe it was my fault and convinced me I should run away. And if that wasn't enough, he sent some hyenas to finish me off!

Jokes on him though, I got away from the hyenas - that's what he gets for being too big of a pussy to kill me himself. So I hook up with these two crazy dudes, I mean batshit insane. They're like Pinky and the Brain you know? One of them's just a doofus and the other's a warthog. But they had good hearts you know? Anyway so I chill for a while and bide my time, I wait until a lioness comes looking for help and confirms that my uncle is weak - his popularity is down in the poles cause he let everything go to shit, he can't fight too well cause there's no food so he's weak. Meanwhile I've been eating protein - bugs and shit, I'm in my prime. 

Timing was right so I went back and beat that throw rug tooth pickin mofo down.  I put him back in his place and tossed him off a cliff, revenge style. 

So I guess it all worked out in the end, I got the land back in balance and now the pack is strong again and I'm bangin lionesses left and right, long dick style. 

Guess that's why they call me ""motherfuckin Simba"". 

Out. "

"As a person who is fascinated by the concept of gray Jedi I agree with some points you made here and disagree with others.

&gt;Morality in itself is meant to highlight the focus on doing right and wrong and abusing the Force. So if the player has no interest in that, then they can just take Obligation or Duty instead if they prefer.

I think the whole concept of the Gray Jedi and the Gray Order actually challenges this statement. The creed of the Gray Order actually states there is no light side or dark side and the idea is being balanced within that spectrum.

&gt;It really doesn't do much for players just wanting to hang out in the middle and provides no real challenges. 

I think there is a difference between a player who wants to hang out in the middle and not be bound to the consequences of dark side or light side and a player who truly wants to play a true gray jedi. If I were playing a gray order jedi (which I am highly interested in) I would be very disappointed if the GM told me not to worry about morality and instead just take an obligation or duty. My character instead is about finding the balance between dark side and light side. Passion yet peace, serenity yet emotion, choas yet order. 

&gt; If you/they rather it keep the Morality mechanic for the player, then one thing to do is to give them a bit of a benefit for bordering the edge of the dark side.

I do like this idea. I actually would maybe suggest something like if a player is +60 they must use light side points to succeed (but can use a strain to use darkside instead of destiny) and vice versa if they are -40 then they use darkside but can use a strain to use lightside. Maybe something like that?  That way it encourages the player to stay in that golden 40-60 spot?

&gt; Having it be in the middle (50) is pretty much pointless. Sure, it's sort of difficult to stay in the 47-53 range, and hard to stay on a specific number (50). But there's no consequence for it. You roll too well on the Morality roll? You just take some extra conflict next session to try and balance it to get in that spot again. You take too much Conflict? No big deal, you can just try and ease up next session. At worst, you're probably landing in the 40's or 60's, which again, doesn't do too much to penalize the player who'll just be as, conceivably, little as 1 session away from getting close to the 50 range again.

I also agree with this. You wouldn't want to encourage a gray jedi player to just play the mechanics. I dont know how to solve this but doing bad things just for the sake of moving the needle closer to 50 seems like it is completely against the concept of a gray jedi. They wouldn't do something bad just so they can be more neutral. Unfortunately, I dont have a good idea on how to encourage this...

In the end, I think my point is... if you have a player who wants to play a true gray jedi then that's fine. But there is difference between a player who doesnt like morality and a player who wants a gray jedi. "

"You know how I can tell you're not there yet, ""what more do I need to do"". That question is filled with problems as it relates to MRP.

What more do I need to do?  Insert the rest of the question here.

-to please my wife?  Why are you seeking your wife's approval?  MRP doesn't work like that.

-to overcome my beta upbringing?  Male hamster at work here.  This is an excuse.  Your past certainly influences your behavior as an adult, but you've taken the pill.  The fact that you know this about your upbringing should enable you to neutralize all but the deepest bad habits.

- ""you only want sex"" stop listening to what your wife says, look at how she behaves.  The only want sex crap is a shit test.  Treat it like one and move on.  Acting like a whiny bitch if you don't get sex is a turn off, withdrawing affection and attention is proper dread and a valid part of MRP.

-the slave master comment was a shit test in an inflammatory form.  You're wife even tells you she wants you to lead.  You should want to lead if for no other reason than controlling your own destiny.  You ask what more you can do- do you make decisions no matter how small?  Do you plan events or excursions for the family on the weekend?  Are you handling any male oriented tasks at your home?  You mentioned your income first thing, are you threatened by her making more than you?  Is this an issue that will resolve itself in due time?  Can you deal with it if it doesn't?

Rereading your text, it doesn't seem like you've grasped what you are doing and for which reasons.  Feels like you are much more concerned about your wife's feefees than handling your shit.  

Can you honestly look in the mirror right now and say you are the best version of yourself?  If not, are you doing the things you need to in order to become that person?  If not, what are you waiting for?"

The Pentagon's ""remote override"" is the rest of the submarine crew, and the fact that they hold the unlocks in the first place (and would just refuse to send them to the boat).

It's for the best anyways, as a ballistic missile submarine could easily be cut completely off of communications from the outside if they chose to, so the Pentagon couldn't rely on being able to send an abort signal."

We live on a planet where green rules over civilizations, but the wrong kind of green, the evil kind. We the people have lost sight of trade, building something of your own, whether you're American or not it is much the same for any man or woman anywhere on this planet, to make it on their own and build something they can be proud of, the human dream. Unfortunately I dare say we are losing not only sight but the appreciation of making it from point A to point B, but no not just on our own. Our societies are not civilized as I previously mentioned, we idolize music stars, actors, and sports athletes and then we secretly wish to achieve our own life of luxury which most of us will never come close to. We have allowed our not-so-civilized civilization to change the way we perceive things such as happiness, love, or even wealth for that matter. I believe Bitcoin is the start of us, the people, deciding what is truly worth us valuing. No longer allowing advertisement companies or magazines or store-bought politicians to decide what we think is valuable.

"#HISTORY BECKONS THE MACHO MAN

Unfortunately, I couldn't (quickly) find any great sources for testosterone production, or even if it's a liquid. I found [this](http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/vm12.htm) webpage which states that the average human being produces 7 mg of testosterone per day. Macho Man is too hot to handle and too cold to hold, however, so we'll estimate that he produces 10 mg per day. [This guy](https://thinksteroids.com/community/threads/pure-testosterone-liquid-real.134279913/) said his doctor gave him ""pure testosterone"" which had a density of 25 mg/mL. It's the best I could find, so I'll assume that that is pure testosterone.

&amp;nbsp;

Now, in order to drown this piece-of-shit shrew, we'll need a liquid level which completely covers the nose of the little bitch, while also filling its lungs. Apparently there are different kinds of shrews, one of which - the [Etruscan shrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etruscan_shrew) - is the smallest mammal on the planet, by mass. I hate yer guts!

&amp;nbsp;

Now I need to figure out the dimensions of this shrew. I'll assume it's a cylinder 4cm tall and has a radius of 0.5cm. I'll put him into this graduated cylinder, available for $4.95, which has a radius of 1.27cm. So, we'll need to fill up the cylinder with enough testosterone to reach a height of 4cm, plus however much will go into the shrew's lungs. I don't really know how to estimate lung size, so I'll say it's a quarter of the lil' guy's volume. 

&gt; Required volume of testosterone = Volume of 4cm on cylinder + Volume of shrew lungs - Volume of shrew

&gt; V = pi(4cm)(1.27)^2 + pi(1cm)(0.5)^2 - pi(4cm)(0.5cm)^2 = 2.73 mL

This would require (2.73 mL)(25 mg/mL) = 68 mg. Therefore, the testosterone produced by about **7 Macho Man Randy Savages in a day** could drown this shrew.

This is where most Christians flip the blame and say God made everything perfect, but we messed it up. 

But even given that argument, it doesn't justify why the system God chose to use for his plan seems to have been so sloppy. As you, and I, have pointed out, the only way around this seems to be to revert back to the ""mysterious ways"" argument. You simply start at the end of the argument and assert, like Divine Command Theory does, that God is all that is good, so even if we don't understand why millions of children have to die from starvation every year, we just need to remind ourselves that God must be doing everything right...because he's God.

As I said, I want something a little more substantial than that. If all of the arguments eventually boil down to ""because the Bible says so"", then we really haven't gotten anywhere.

1. Take a viscous beating, that may fuck you up REAL bad.

2. Let you husband take the beating, but if he does, he'll be fucked up and get paralyzed. Not just legs, but arms too. So he can't dress, eat, fuck, fix the house, help with kids, get in and out of bed, and perhaps most horribly: can't wipe his own ass . . . all for life. 50 more freakin years.

Presented this way, realistically the wife might take her chances and take the beating.

"I have a whole bunch of suggestions I wish you'd take.  There's the standard exercise, and quite putting any garbage into your body, stuff..  which is huge.  However, I'd suggest getting blood work done, and having an endocrinologist take a look at it.  I've known people who benefited tremendously by drinking water, and adding fish oil, and vitamin D, supplements to their routine.

We're meant to be free animals, and the pursuit of happiness is a lot tougher when we're not.  I'd say clean your dietary intake impeccably, and start living as freely as you can.  Work for yourself doing something productive that you enjoy &amp; believe in.  Cut costs to a minimum.  Barter &amp; use bitcoin as much as possible.  There's a place for you, you've just got to find it.  The only freedom there is for any of us in this life is that that we make for ourselves.  Good luck!"

"&gt;In 1860, 89 percent of the nation's African Americans were slaves; blacks formed 13 percent of the country's population and 33 percent of the South's population.

[Source](http://www.gilderlehrman.org/history-by-era/slavery-and-anti-slavery/resources/facts-about-slave-trade-and-slavery)

As of the [2010 census](http://www.prisonpolicy.org/reports/rates.html), 13% of the American population is Black. Black people account for 40% of the prison population, and the incarceration rate is 2,306 per 100,000 Black people.

But the thing about slavery is, a lot of people never made it off the boat -- they died on the way over. Also many slaves didn't come to the US -- by 1825, 3/4 of the black slave population was in the Caribbean or South America."

BURN!). Pretty sure they'll sell your (anonymized) GPS data though, as everyone else already does that (looking at you, Twatbook).

Anyways, here are some tips for keeping your data safe*.

**iOS**

You can manage the permissions for apps through the settings menu. Just toggle the ones you don't like off, and you can rest assured that your dick pics are once again safe*.

**Android**

Google is the sligthly more evil zaibatsu in this case, having sided with app makers' right to snoop on you over your right to manage permissions as you see fit. You only get two choices; accept all permissions forever, or don't install. Luckily, this can be fixed by installing a third party app such as [XPrivacy](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=biz.bokhorst.xprivacy.installer). XPrivacy can also spoof your data so apps don't crash and burn when they're not allowed to read your contact list or whatever.

One small catch; changing permissions requires your device to be rooted. Sounds scary? It isn't. If you can google and are capable of following simple instructions, rooting is easy.

"I think it depends on who you have in your team. Some people are amazing at setting up goals, while others can get crazy angles to somehow find the net.

If that makes sense. I don't think any top team uses rigid positions, but I'd imagine a lot of players have a preference for an area of the field. "

"&gt; But in an emergency situation...?

If this were the case, it would need to be standard practice, and present - as you've suggested - through the lifespan of all skyscrapers in New York (and possibly elsewhere).  That's a testable hypothesis: do any other buildings have charges in them?

The obvious counter arguments are, ""Only the buildings that came down contained charges"" and, ""Following the demolition, charges were taken out of other buildings to cover them up"".  The first would be quite a significant coincidence.  It would also weaken the the idea that some powerful organization strongly believed demolition charges were required in skyscrapers - as they were unable to get them into any other buildings.  The second, given that we've already argued the charges must go in during construction, seems like a considerable amount of work.  This too is a testable hypothesis: was there a humongous spree renovating all or most skyscrapers in NY in the years following 9/11?

These sorts of testable hypotheses can be teased out of any assertion on how the world works.  They must be done to support any idea, and more are required for the very large claims typically associated with conspiracy theories.  Any theory that rests on no testable ideas must be thrown out immediately (or boxed pending the discovery of workable tests)."

"Dual flamer can be fun, and seems powerful against newer players, but it can be easily countered by either chemical spray and heatsink, or by advanced planning by a captain. The dual flamer, and most pyramid builds lack a ranged game. Most newer matches turn out that players just rush eachother, so the dual flame works. A smart player will chose to either engage this ship at a longer range with a build such as lumber-fish, long range spire, ect or engage with a disable type build composed of weapons like hwatchas or Artemis. There are a lot of weaknesses and strengths in every ship build, and how you use that build decides the fate of the match. Experiment with other builds as much as you can, makes the game so much more fun.

I get your general point that many of these instances are societal rather than institutional, but does that make them less impactful?  If anything, it just means they are *much* harder to combat.  A rule/law can be overturned.  No one can tell you that an existing rule/law ""isn't real"".

&gt; The gender of a politician doesn't determine the quality of the job they do, nor the policies they enact. 

This is actually not true.  People's life experiences play a big role in how they move through the world.  That includes politicians.

I'll try to find the study, but there was something released semi-recently that showed that groups with higher levels of diversity are actually more efficient at completing tasks.  When you have a group of people with different backgrounds and experiences, that comes across in the way they approach a task.  A wide variety of approaches means finding the best approach faster.

&gt; What do you mean? Where I live, there are male and female school uniforms.

In the states, we don't have uniforms (usually).  Grade school girls are systemically chastised for anything remotely revealing. [Here's an example](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/3h0yab/this_girl_was_sent_home_today_from_a_high_school/) that was posted to reddit just earlier this week.

&gt; You do realise this is an issue associated just as much if not more with men right? Newspapers call rape 'affairs', rape victims told they must be gay if they didn't enjoy it, Subway Jarrod getting a footlong in prison hahahah isn't rape hilarious?

*Absolutely agree*.

However, the cultural underpinnings of this are very anti-woman.

When a woman is raped, the rhetoric is often ""She was asking for it"", or something similar.  The victim is blamed for *secretly wanting* the attack to happen.

When a man is raped, the rhetoric is often more punitive and/or an attack on that man's masculinity.  The victim ""deserved"" it, either because they are in prison or because they weren't ""man enough"" to stop it.

Both of those are *incredibly* fucked up, but they are different.  Mostly in that the way men are meant to feel bad is because the rape feminized them (""haha, you got raped, you're not a 'real man'""), whereas the women are meant to feel bad because it's apparently an expected part of being a woman in public (""why didn't you cover every last inch of skin if you didn't want to be attacked?"")."
"why does riot punish toxic people? because they are toxic...

they earned rewards fair and square? riot owns league of legends, even if it seems like a jerk thing to do, they can ban people just because they want to. if they want to take away rewards for toxic players that 'earned them' then they are able to do so. you might think its wrong and a lot of other toxic people think its wrong too, but riot thinks its right and theres also a lot of people thinking its right

is there a right and wrong? no. but what riot does with their game is up to them. toxic people are crying now because they wont get rewards but maybe they should learn to not be jerks. 

why boosters are getting rewards? maybe if you stop acting superior and actually read what i write instead of sticking to your opinion stubbornly then you can see i gave the answer. i know you wont find it by yourself so i'll tell you: lyte cant do everything at once. he chose not to focus on boosted people at the moment which is why they will get rewards... if they havent already gotten banned that is, since boosting is bannable. its his way of punishing toxic people by taking their rewards since theres still lots of toxic people despite restricts and bans being issued out and hes trying something else, especially since theres lots of threads complaing about lack of punishment for toxic people.. and when he finally punishes them he gets hated on"

For example, the round where Maikelele pushed long A alone and picked Ska, then Sean called a full rotate from B to A, while the other four Kinguin players waited in upper dark and then took B uncontested. A coach could've called that, while Sean had made an ""Anti-Strat"" early call that was completely wrong.

- It's a Jindo. It needs socialization or it's going to end up being a monster. Socialization with the family is not nearly enough. 

My dog was raised from 0-8 weeks outside on a farm. She was a nervous mess when I got her. Whether you want to blame it more on genetics or on the fact that she was an outdoor dog, she's got issues that have taken years to work on and she will never be the type of dog I wanted. It takes a very serious, involved person to make an outdoor dog an acceptable family member, and I'm not getting that at all from your description of your family.

I give Method a little of advantage, but not anything significant.

**My odds:** Method 53-47 3sUP

**My bet:** [Low on 3sUP](http://i.imgur.com/L7p3UnN.png)

"I think you should start by asking how exactly magic is going to be used to improve the lives of (at least the rich) people. 

Teleportation/flight/animated objects pulling supply trains is going to be a big one, so you will need a guild of transport.

Cities are definitely getting built using magic, for construction, lighting, water supply/waste management, and communications. Maybe call it the guild of public works?

What does your labor force look like? The rich probably have unseen servants or maybe summoned beings from other planes. Planar binding is a hell of a spell if you have the mages capable of of a lot of casting it as a 9th lv spell. The same goes for animated objects. I'd say you want a Guild of Labor.

What about entertainment and new distribution? I'm sure some enterprising artificers could construct something similar to a television using synced major images. At the very least, every bueracracy needs someone to interact with the press. Hence a Guild of the Media. 

What role does religion serve in your world? The gods might be pleased by the mages bringing law and order to the land, or they might see their experiments as a disruption to the natural balance. Someone will have to deal with the interaction between divine and arcane magics. 

Even if you want to make the mages relatively benevolent, every government wants to know what is going on in its lands. There are probably hundreds of wizards devoted solely to scrying on potential dissidents or spying on neighboring nations. Hence the Guild of Information. 

Lastly, you want a wild card group that handles the important things that fall through the cracks. What happens when a wizard invents a time travel spell and starts messing up the time stream? Who's job is it to prevent crazed sorcerers from putting iron golems into orbit then dropping them on cities? How do you prevent a suicide bomber walking into the capital building with a portable hole and bag of holding? There should be a secret guild, (maybe the Guild of the Apocalypse?) who's only job is to prevent magic from bringing the world to an early end. "

"Talk about bad analogies. ; )

Gronk and Bell are far and clear the most consistent and best performers at their positions when they are healthy and on the field. That's not the same for Julio... not even close.

In PPR... Brown is a model of consistency and high average... and he has been for two seasons. IIRC Brown never scored less than 15 points last season... while Julio scored less than 10 several times.

Your first picks should be about consistency (standard deviation) and safety (high floor). Brown wins over Julio on both of those... and he wins easily.

Don't get me wrong... in my redraft (and non PPR) league... I'll be stoked to have julio as my WR1... I'm not saying he sucks (I rank him #3 in Standard). But if there is an argument to outright rank Julio over Brown in a PPR format I'd love to hear it... cause I don't think a reasonable one exists."

both mdframed and tcolorbox are implemented in tikz :) they were both created to make fancy boxes like that easier. at its core, this isn't really a fancy box – it's decoration.

in the up-to-date manual, see pages 249/250. these correspond to §17.13 ""Referencing Nodes Outside the Current Picture"".

tcolorbox is just better-maintained than mdframed. it also is a bit more expressive, in my experience. still, i recommend tikz for this application :)"

"I doubt it's nashetania, though it's mainly because I find her likable so I don't want her to be the 7th

I also don't think flemie is completely in the clear, since if she kills adlet, and the fog doesn't disappear, everyone would start looking for the real culprit, and the immediate suspect would flemie herself, but again, I don't want flemie to be 7th since she is also likable

I don't think chamot has any motive to be the 7th (she feels like an innocent, though with a very twisted personality, kid still, and she, being the strongest saint, has a very easy life with little suffering, the worst suffering she has had is probably just boredom), and since she is said to be the strongest saint, it's hard to imagine her not to be chosen as a legit rokka (since they choose the 6 strongest humans)

hans appears to be the most suspicious to the viewers (who know that adlet isn't the 7th), but because of how obvious it would be had he been the 7th, I don't think it's him (too many red herrings in mystery anime/books/movies/any media that I am conditioned to think that the most suspicious one is the least suspicious one)

I also don't think it's goldolf since he has a huge crush on his hime, and since hime would likely die if the demon lord isn't killed, he has motive to NOT be the 7th; however, if he is promised some paradise where he and hime can live in love and peace, then maybe he would have to motive

I honestly don't have a read on maura yet, she looks to be both legit and suspect at the same time, shrug, I will need more to make a judgment on her

lastly, I am not counting adlet as completely legit even though he is the protagonist and all, it's not impossible that we have been lured in by the author to root for a villain, it's also possible that adlet has split personality issues or something given his tragic past"

Some other forms of service include posting at the local court house, in the newspaper, or in some states leaving with family members.

"If the intent is to win, then prioritize self-improvement above all else. How you handle suboptimal teammates is part of that improvement. 

That is an extreme amount of pressure. That's over 3 seconds of hard CC with a burst AD caster, on a relatively short cooldown. Get in range of either of them, and the ADC will get chunked to half or less, forcing going back to base. How you win against the lane is by not dying, which you did fine with but the ADC didn't know how to handle as well.

You can't always win every game. In situations like those, recognize that winning is unlikely, and look instead at what can be improved on. I often use games like that for getting in skillshot or warding practice, or forcing myself into impossible 2v1s and trying to see I handle it.

In addition, assuming yourself to be consistently positive, your team has 4 chances of bad players while the enemy team has 5 chances. Recognize that you will benefit from subpar players and legitimate trolls than you will lose to them. In the grand scheme, that Tristana experience was part of that inherent random toxicity that you got on the unfortunate side of, but you may find in the future that the opposite will be true.

It is, however, much easier to remember negative experiences than positive ones. Keep that in mind before feeling that you've been unlucky more than not. I often take objective count of those situations and find that the 4:5 ratio is true, even if my intuition and memory may not always agree."

"It's not impossible to get a job without a degree. You will need to justify it, however, with a solid portfolio and lots of experience.

You might need to take any job you can get at first, within the industry, just to get your foot in the door and get some work experience.

There are always options for getting a degree, and I think it might be easier than you think it is. Community college is a great way to start, and often times have very reasonable financial aid packages. From there you can transfer to a 4-year school which might have options for non-traditional students (nights, weekends).

For-profit universities get shit on here a lot, and -- *some* -- for good reason. Just having had this conversation yesterday, I will say that the [University of Phoenix is accredited](http://hlcommission.org/component/directory/?Itemid=&amp;form_submitted=TRUE&amp;institution=University%20of%20Phoenix&amp;lang=en&amp;showquery=&amp;siteOrg=&amp;state=ANY&amp;submit=Search) by the HLC, and is an option for getting an online degree while working.

Granted, even with an accredited degree from a for-profit school, you'll be fighting perception, so perhaps start with a community college route. 

Honestly, it will be much easier with a degree, but not impossible without one."

"in this situation, contrary to another post i just responded to, /legaladvice is a better subreddit than this one. your boss is right to be concerned that if mishandled, adverse publicity could ruin his business. or the cops could come in, take every computer, and give them back 6 months later.

what i'd suggest: have boss schedule a meeting with the guy, say, ""i dont think you're a good fit here. i'd like your resignation"".

that's probably enough to do the trick. if pressed, he could say ""your background check came in and raised a few red flags.""
this is hypothetical since you didnt mention a state. he can ask his lawyer how to handle a termination if its not an at will state. once he's gone, you could then drop a dime, after checking any machines he's had access to for malware.

"Dota has more flexible meta. And i dont mean just the heroes(though that isnt that flexible in the current patch) or even the items but the lanes. You can have 3/1/1, 2/1/2, 1/1/3, 1/1/2+jungler. You can decide to completely lose specific lanes, you can get completely countered or deliberately face 1 vs 3 lanes. Or you can rotate lanes because you got countered and then the enemy can rotate their lanes to keep you countered.

You have items like smokes and day/night cicles which greatly open the opportunity for ganking and rotations. And with teleportation scrolls, your teammates can react to those ganks and teleport to your tower and counter initiate. And towers dont do infinity dmg, so tower dives are more viable.

On average, dota games have way more kills per minute than lol has(almost twice as much). What you mean by boring, you probably mean that you cant spam your abilities so much during laning. Because that's what you do in lol. In dota, you are supposed to do other things(stack, pull, gank, zone). Also in dota, abilities dont scale with items so they hurt/stun A LOT by default. So they cant be as spammable."

"I think getting a new puppy so soon after losing his baby of fourteen years was a bad idea. He misses her, not saying that you don't either but he had ten more years with her, but this isn't normally new puppy behavior. He's using this as a way to not heal from his previous dog's death.  

Sit him down and explain that you know he's hurting, but that he is preventing you from bonding with the puppy. This is a very bad thing for the family dynamic as you both need to be seen as ""authority figures"". He's setting the stage for a puppy that he may not being able to effectively train AND for a dog that doesn't listen to you. 

And wait. Did you really give up your front seat and sit in the back of the car so the dog can sit up front? Nip that in the bud now. Eventually she'll want to climb in the lap of the driver not to mention the fact that the front seat airbags could instantly kill her if they were to go off even due to a minor accident. "

"There's a number of big bubbles bursting as we speak. China is a big one. What's happening in Europe is a giant case of delaying the inevitable. You can expect a fair amount of chaos soon after the US raises interest rates as well (keeping them artificially low is a major reason the recession ""stopped"" and once they go back up casino capitalism is going to go back to it's full, unstable, glory)

Anyway, I'd argue the economy is never not in crisis. Sometimes it's just more noticeable then other times. One of the lovely features of neoliberalism is a constant, rapidly accelerating, cycle of speculative bubbles and collapses that thanks to deregulation of financial markets turn into huge economic contagions. 

I don't think I have ever in my life seen financial analysts say the situation is ""good"". They usually say it's good *for now* and then tack on some dire prediction. In fact it's almost like they can't decide whether the system works perfectly or if it's doomed within the next few years. Everytime profits skyrocket so does the potential of something going horribly wrong. Every bull market is waiting to be mauled to death by a bear. 

To put it bluntly, capitalism just doesn't work. Maybe a common opinion in these parts, but I mean even by capitalism's standards capitalism doesn't really work. In theory the market is supposed to regulate itself but it does the total opposite. It's almost impossible to effectively decipher and when you do you realize it's basically just jumping up and down in a schizophrenic cycle with virtually no rhyme or reason to it. 

So economic turmoil isn't on the horizon: it's already here. We just choose not to call it that.

"I had a similar experience. I was a casual meditator for years with no profound effects. It just calmed me, cleared my mind, and gave me space to think. Just recently I did a 10 day vipassanna course and it was profound. Now I can tap into that on my own. If you can spare 2 weeks, I'd check our dhamma.org. These retreats are 100% free. If you don't have the time, I found the book mindfulness in plain English to be very good. It resonated with my experience at vipassanna so it might work for you. It's also free. The key with meditation is that you need to give yourself the time to go deep. Focus on your breath and bodily sensations. Make sure you let your body and mind relax. Remain equanimous. If you let yourself become agitated or frustrated you are going the wrong direction. "

"Governments that are killing people for their sexuality are horrible. That being said, as a gay person in a country like this, did they really think it was a good idea to put their name and pictures up online for everyone to see? I'm not saying they should pay with their life for it but that sounds like they were playing with fire to begin with.

People in abusive relationships were also risking the same thing. Instead of going and correcting a bad situation, they were going behind their partner's back (even if he/she was a POS). Everyone on that site knew they were risking something a little bit to fulfill sexual urges. They ALL knew there could be consequences if someone saw their pic or their significant other found out (for the couples at least).

Moral of the story don't do shit behind your so's back. No matter the situation, it's ALWAYS better to be honest about how you're feeling or if that isn't possible because of abuse seek help and get out of that situation. 

I'm not morally superior or pretending to be but I am honest with my spouse about everything. I tell her I watch porn(so does she), we watch it together. I tell her (as does she) when I think someone is hot and then we move on. We even tell each other about someone flirting with us that day. It's called building a relationship on trust and being open with your spouse. People need to stop leading this double life and getting so upset when it catches up with them. "

"There are a lot of reasons....some not completely fit for discussion on a public forum.  He wanted pretty much full control of the program above and beyond that of a normal coach.  Basically wanted to operate fully on his own and go above the athletic director on some issues.  Then it comes down to ego and money.  

&amp;nbsp;

I don't blame him for leaving WVU for Michigan.  It's a big step up in prestige and pay.  The animosity stems from a bunch of things.  The timeline was strange.  He had just signed an extension and a couple days previous had given a presser about how he's home and going to be our coach until we kick him out.....then just abruptly dumped us in the middle of the night right after the most heartbreaking loss in school history.  A lot of people still maintain he threw the game.  I know a couple of bigtime boosters that claim there's irrefutable evidence and they know factually that he threw the game but don't want to give specifics out.  Granted these guys are the types that would actively follow r/conspiracy if they were redditors, but they also seem to know all the backroom dealings and everything about everything in the athletic department, so I tend to believe what they tell me.  Leaving pat white out of the game once he was cleared to come back in having injured his thumb on his non-throwing hand is baffling...and our OC at the time Calvin McGee had said something that RichRod had overridden about 80% of his playcalls that game, which was apparently way more than he'd ever done before.  Oh well....past is past....that day sucks.

&amp;nbsp;

Anyways more than that I feel like the blue collar WV folk really value loyalty and honesty way more than the rest of the world seems to in this day and age.  We pretty much felt like he lied and then turned his back on the state.  Basically said he was too good for his home (he grew up in WV and played for WVU) and it hurt.  Like a woman that marries her highschool sweetheart then years later renews her vows with her husband, then the next day he leaves her for a swimsuit model.  Most people would say ""upgrade!"" but the woman is crushed."

"That's an adverb. It can only modify a verb. You can tell from the -ly suffix, like ""he runs swiftly"" (modifying runs) or ""we cheat frequently"" (modifying cheat).

In this case, the adjective ""arbitrary"" describes ""requirement"", as in ""the **requirement** is arbitrary"".

""Arbitrarily"" is an adverb, and would modify ""is"" in this sentence, which doesn't make much sense. You would need another verb to modify, because ""to be"" doesn't take kindly to adverbs. Like ""The standard was arbitrarily **applied**."""

With the info we have today AMD cards look better. If a buying is looking between a 390 and a 970 from which will last them for 4 years and benefit from dx12 better, with the information available the 390 looks like a much better choice. Same goes for 380 vs 960 etc. If you're buying today you can be an informed buyer and take the only information we have on dx12 into consideration."

"We had a HUGE number of people invited, everybody from my church, and held it at my same church. The church cost was low, but the giant number of people meant we had to think of everything in terms of huge multiples.

The church also has a reception area in the building, so we didn't have to rent that separately. Another bonus was that previous brides who decorated the church often left their decorations in the storage room (what else do you do with all that ribbon and tulle?) for future brides to use. 

We just served cake and punch, I think maybe there were some nuts and mints. There was a wedding cake with tiers and all, but for that many people, we also had sheet cake in the same flavor.

Also, several people made presents of covering part of the wedding cost. My aunt bought my dress, a family friend bought the cake, and so on. 

I'm a good amateur calligrapher, so I addressed the invitations myself.

We also printed off the invitations ourselves: a sheet of heavy shimmery green paper, a slightly smaller sheet of white paper with the words printed in green ink, and a sheet of shimmery transparent paper the size of the green paper, with a green ribbon threaded through holes at the top and tied in a boss.

"It doesn't sound to me like you're going to find a happy spot in this.

No amount of therapy is going to help you be okay with the idea that your wife is having an affair on you, emotionally or physically.

But, it's your choice. if you'd rather stay with her and not interfere in her obvious desire to be with other people and find emotional and (likely) physical satisfaction, then that's on your. Just realize that you're likely going to keep being unhappy, likely resentful, and it'll be real hard for you to move past this.

Honestly, I wouldn't put up with it. You sound like someone who deserves a partner that wants to have YOU as their greatest support, who treats you with respect, and doesn't need to find emotional and physical redemption from other men. You're disrespecting yourself by staying with her and letting her have free reign to do whatever she wants. Even if she says you can do the same, that's clearly not what you want. "

&gt; In a neighborhood, a family named the Klopeks move into a old house and act very unusual. Everyone nearby is concerned why these people are acting strange and the people have never seen them before. Plus, no one has greeted them for the month they've moved in there. Then 3 people group up to see if they can figure out what is really going on with the Klopeks.

"He has asked me what he can do for me, but I'm just not interested in it as much as he is. I don't remember the last time he touched me for me (a hug, a foot rub, holding my hand, snuggling) instead of for him (grabbing my butt or boobs). I initiate the hugs etc.

"Yes , he did, however at this point he seems pretty over kids.  We had a very long discussion about separating.  He eventually came to the conclusion that leaving me to search for another woman who would be willing to go through invitro was not particularly likely.  He hated dating and while sad he does not have his own kids, he has reached the grumpy older guy stage where most kids just flat out annoy him.  We helped a friend and took their 2 adorable and very well mannered kids for a long weekend and he could not wait to give them back.  So while yes he regrets it, and I do feel bad for digging my heels in(as I think he would have made a good but lazy father) we are ok as a couple."

"I agree, as far as attention getting and a very juvenile (but deadly) way of doing it. I posted this because I had seen no media mention, as far as mainstream, and saw it only because I had a Google Alert for something slightly different. Also correct in the *gaping power voids* of our (US) creation.
What I see as a main stumbling block, though, is an unwillingness to confront a culture who subjugates women, gives them no rights, and when confronted with defiance, kills them.
I also believe that this unwillingness is less political correctness and more that is a reflection of the beliefs of a majority of the US government. Look no further than the recent threats of government shutdown, over Women's Health Services, based on a Pro Life sting, and the SCOTUS ruling that grants Religious Convictions, even for Corporations, to trump logic and responsibility. 
I think for any change in the Mideast, there has to be fundamental changes here, and a recognition that people are more important than Iron Age Ideology, and that ISIS, regardless of their proclaiming of faith, are still no better than the Narco's who commit these same atrocities. "

"Personally I'm not a big fan of the don't ask don't tell policy.  I think being too closed about this sort of communication isn't really in the spirit of openness can lead to distrust and can potentially be risky health-wise if not everyone is practicing safe-sex.  In order to be sure of this certain communication channels need to be open.  I can understand the tendency to try to protect one's feelings by not sharing too much, but having tried both I have to say I felt a lot better when I knew more rather than less about my partner's partners.  Communication tends toward trust and feeling 'safer' in situations.  While I didn't need a blow by blow retelling of every sexual act, knowing my partners were content and being treated well in their other relationships gave me peace of mind.  My friends and people in my social circle actually felt much safer to me because I already knew and trusted them.  I would even try to set-up my partners with my friends if there was a mutual interest.  The people I loved, cared about, cherished and trusted were people I felt good about sharing. I would encourage you to try to open lines of communication with your partner about their other partners.  It may feel uncomfortable at first but you may find that in the long run it engenders trust and comfort in the relationship.  "

You're right.  If you did something you knew could lead to someone's death, and went ahead without exercising *reasonable care*, you have violated your duty, committed negligence, and are at least civilly liable.

"You can't think of any circumstances where someone without a gun or knife could put somebody's life in imminent danger? What if the kid was reaching for a police officer's gun? What if the kid jumped the cop and the began smashing the cop's head into the ground? What if the kid hopped in a car and tried to drive over a cop?

Why would you ***immediately***, with very few facts, judge the police to be not only wrong, but so egregiously wrong that we should protest them (and no doubt call for punishments that may not be warranted?)

It's insane that every single police killing is immediately protested. It's clear that this is more about rebelling against authority than addressing any real problems. Protests are going on even though, for all we know, this department could have reacted to earlier demands by protesters and could be wearing body cams, outsourcing investigations, and increasing transparency.

If you want real reforms, conduct your protests better. Take control of your message and only protest when it's truly warranted. Otherwise, you're going to be considered nothing more than a nuisance by moderate voters (i.e. the people who can actually drive change.)"

It's not that it's a close call, it costs less by a large margin.  

From there you can pick the publication that you trust the most, but **none** of them are going to tell you the opposite.  They will tell you their ideas *why* or they might use different stats to sway the argument a bit, but the net result is unavoidable.

I make sure to squeeze out excess water with an old t-shirt and then let air dry with a different old tshirt across my shoulders/back to make sure there's a protective layer between my skin and the super product-upped hair.

"Now that you suggest it, I kind of agree that a letter would probably be pointless. I've accepted the fact that they will never understand or be capable of change, but part of me wants to for closure for myself. But I have to remember that anything I write to them can and will be used for ammo.

Yeah, I feel like no matter what I say, they'll have some smart-ass retort that just makes me feel bad. i get the ""But I'm your mother/father"" and ""I did the best I could."" Once, I opened up to my mom about how much they hurt me, when we were having lunch a few years ago. She justified everything with those same remarks. Just pointless. 

Explaining myself has never worked - I was always too sensitive, dramatic, selfish, blowing it out of proportion - no matter how benign my actions were. My dad almost hit me once over the REMOTE, and I had to lock myself in the bathroom. I was tooootally overreacting, even though my mother had to kick him out of the house for me to come out. Everything was back to ""normal"" a few hours later.

I've been ignoring their texts and calls for this long, so I'm pretty sure I can keep going. I still just feel my stomach drop every time they do it, and I still feel guilty, although I know they don't deserve that. It gets easier each time. My therapist says that no matter what, I don't have to do anything I don't want to, especially if I think I could never live with myself later.

I like that. I control when I speak to them. The amount of ""You don't call anymore"" voicemails I get at this point is way too much for me to consider wanting to answer. I'm not going to do something because they're guilting me. My mom also found my passport - that she SWEARS I didn't give to her when I went to college, when I distinctly remember doing so. Doesn't expire til 2019, and I want it. I need to figure out how to get it, as well as a few more things from my one room, while they're not home. She's trying to use that to drag me back in, too.

Now I have a family that, after only 2 years, treats me with so much more kindness and respect than my parents have in 23 years. That alone should show that it's time for the axe. I just don't know if it will affect my relationship with my mom's side of the family. I'm not sure if my parents would make a big deal out of this or just not talk about it, like they usually do. I guess I shouldn't expect it to be different this time.

I don't even want my parents to see me get married. I don't even want a wedding at all because the thought makes me so uncomfortable because their teasing has made me feel uncomfortable with showing femininity/sexuality. If I ever have kids, which I firmly do not want to do, I wouldn't want them to be around their grandparents, especially alone. How can I know these things, yet it's so hard to cut them off?

Should I just answer their call one day when I'm feeling up to it? I want things to be civil at least, because I still have health insurance through them, which I absolutely need to have, and can't afford to lose. I got my own auto policy and cell plan this year, and that is my only tie to them that I can't sever until (in a perfect world) I get a job with benefits. I'm afraid that they would go to that extreme to try to force me into interacting with them. I am in no way broke after my car settlement and all my savings, and they would use that as justification. I can just see it all now.

Thank you for your response :)"

It was real socialism, and the massive improvements in living standards, poverty levels, reduced inequality etc were some of the best achievements of any socialist government. 

Furthermore Chavez's constitutional reforms and his embrace of the native/indigenous population brought very large numbers of people into the democatic process who had been previously frozen out by the minority of wealthy white people. This ranks as one of the greatest emancipatory actions of the 20th century, bringing democracy to people who had been systematically excluded for centuries by the benefactors of imperialism."

The scout helicopter needs a huge nerf in one of the 3 key areas: Defense capabilities, Offensive capabilities, or agility. I don't see how anyone could argue about this because there's literally no downside to the scout helicopter, the only thing people should argue about is how it should be nerfed. Should the mobility speed be dropped to BF3 levels? Should the weapons do much, much less damage? Or should in-flight repair capabilities be removed entirely?"

Have an idea of what your skills are-what you are good at, strengths, etc... Are you a people person? Good with math or writing? Things like that. Finding out what you are naturally talented in will help you eliminate career options that you might not do well. Then start thinking about topics and subjects you like that match up with your skills and sign up for a few intro classes to those. If you are still unsure, meet with your advisor once there or your high school guidance counselor before you leave. "

You can only see the dude in the passenger side rear seat getting shot.  I'm really not sure why you are bending over backwards to justify this shooting in these comments.  Your other comment says it looked like the driver tried to pull a gun on him.......but it's obvious you can't even see the driver in the video, but then now you are saying that the video is too grainy to even tell what's going on.

Top 5 flyweight John Lineker just got bumped up, and he might look even better now that he won't be cutting so much weight. And Chris Holdsworth, should he ever get past his concussion woes, is also an interesting (and young) addition to the division.

Bantamweight is kind of lacking at the moment, it's true. But all of these guys can help breath some new life into the division, and hopefully some of them may even give TJ a good run for his money (but probably not)."

"Han Cholo! All these rings excluding the Punisher one are Han Cholo rings, they are super heavy, the Chief skull ring is going to give my finger abs, they have some great designs and are relatively cheap(under $100 USD).

It's the first gold piece of jewelry I have owned and it's put me off owning something that isn't legitimately gold as the sterling silver versions usually look better. 

My only advice is to google the ring and try to find what it looks like on someones hand, sometimes they are a lot bigger or smaller than what they look like in the photos. "

"* Treat school like a job. Weekdays should be for studying and academics, and the weekends are when you can (and should!) let loose.

* Don't be afraid to say no to drinking/drugs/etc, but college IS the best time to experiment with that IMO. Obviously don't do anything stupid or irresponsible, and there's no need to ever do anything more than drinking/weed/MAYBE shrooms or acid. If you do choose to do that, know your limits. If you've never drank before, take it slow and ease yourself into it, you'll find your limit eventually. 

* Go to class.

* Go to class.

* GO THE FUCK TO CLASS.

* Don't eat shit all the time, because now you don't have people to tell you that you can't. 

* Be responsible for yourself and your actions, because you don't have anyone to take the fall for you.

* Be social! One of the best parts of college is finding a group of friends that will seriously last for the rest of your life. Don't let that go to waste by sitting in your room alone. Every freshman is in the same position as you: they don't know a lot of people if anyone and want to make friends. All you have to do is interact nicely, it's really that simple. And if you weren't the most popular kid in high school? Fuck it. Reinvent yourself completely. Fake that confidence until you internalise it. If you were a social kid in high school? Keep doing exactly what you're doing.

"My point is that there is a great deal more public outcry to bring this man to justice than there is to deal with many more serious issues. Most people are putting a lot more effort into protesting this man's actions than to combating the sex or drug trade, or other major issues. You say I'm trying to distract people from the issues, but I say it's petty bullshit like this that distracts people from the real problems in this world. 
He's a ""cold-blooded hunter"" because he paid money to go to Africa and hunt a dangerous animal? Maybe, but cold-blooded-ness takes on many more horrible forms, don't you think? There are others who do a lot more damage, aren't there? So why go after this guy, instead of those other ""cold-blooded"" people? I think there are a few answers to that question: 

1) Going after someone or something more important and more powerful would require a very special component: work. Basically, it's too hard. People would actually have to spend time and money to combat real atrocities, and why would they go to all that trouble when they can sit at home on their computer, or go to an afternoon protest and feel like they're doing just as much good? (Which, let's face it, they aren't) 

2) This pushes peoples' buttons. It's easy to rile people up about this sort of thing because they aren't desensitized to it. It's like when you watch a violent action movie without flinching, but when a dog dies on screen, that's the part that gets to you. This is what the media is doing with this lion. They call it by its name, and refer to it as one would a person. Please understand, I regret its loss too, but it is not a human being. They say it was innocent, and maybe that’s true, but no more so than many suffering people all over the planet.

3) People like to have the odds on their side. One man is seen as something people can succeed against; they can ""get"" him. But even though his crime may be relatively minor, and the impact of bringing him to justice insignificant, no one likes to fight the more important, more widespread battles, because then they won't get the instant gratification of seeing the fruits of their labor. It’s possible that even after devoting your time to solving a serious problem, that problem would still exist. You will have helped a great many people, but you may still not have won the war. People don't like that feeling, they don't like fighting battles they can't win, even when just fighting is enough to save people from a great deal of pain. So they stick to the battles they know they can win, and don't bother with the rest. Because tragically, a lot of people think it's about them, about sharing a page on Facebook so their friends can see what a great person they are. Unfortunately, most aren’t as concerned with alleviating suffering as they would have people think.

There is, in fact, a lot people can (but generally don't) do to combat some of the evil in the world. Compassion International, for instance, does some great work helping women who have been victimized by the sex trade. People could help them by donating, or by volunteering, but that would require effort and sacrifice. Problems are all around us. I guarantee your nearest large city contains someone in need of help, maybe they need a hot meal, maybe a place to sleep. Either way, I promise there is something you can do to help.
For example, this dentist, like me, is from Minnesota. Duluth is one of the largest hubs in the country for sex slavery. We know this, but I have never once seen a protest on the central hillside of Duluth to put a stop to it. Why? Well, I hope I'm wrong about this, but I believe it’s because people just learn to accept it. Yeah, we knit our brows and shake our heads sadly when the topic comes up, but deep down we feel it's just something that exists in this world. It's so widespread, how could we ever hope to stop it? So we huddle around our computer screens and lash out at easier targets: maybe a celebrity will make a racist comment, or a newscaster will say something insensitive, so we can spring into action, keyboards flashing, trying to be the loudest to cry for justice, when in reality, many of us wouldn’t lift a finger to help any real victims.
Forgive my heated words, my goal is not to offend anyone, but I find it profoundly upsetting the things people will ignore, and the hills they will die on. But I digress...
I most certainly did not imply that ""because supposedly few American are poachers that some justifies this American's actions."" I merely stated that there are others who do much worse, so basically, why don't we have bigger fish to fry? Also, is it somehow worse that he paid to kill one animal rather than getting paid to kill many? I think most likely not, but I’m not going to harp on it. Let’s let that statement speak for itself and move on.

There are two points you make with which I actually agree, and they are these: 
1) It is possible to devote attention to multiple important issues. Yes, it is, and my only question is, if so, why don't more people do so? They certainly don’t, but I think I addressed that fairly well above, so let's move on.
2) Yes, the world is imperfect, and yes, if everyone did their best, we could mitigate more than some of the harm in the world. To which I ask, why this guy? I'm not judge or jury, and neither are you, but is this really justice? To ruin the life of a man as payment for the life of an animal is madness. He does not deserve to be punished any more than he has been. I doubt if this man’s career will ever recover from this ruthless attack. Why do his actions warrant such scrutiny? People torture and kill other people every day and we gloss over it, but he did something distasteful to us, and he makes the news? At what point our priorities get so skewed?

My point to all this is that before we condemn this man’s motives or actions, we should examine our own. People are attacking this guy, but in the grand scope of things, how will it help? People are just being mean-spirited. Just because something seems disgusting to you that’s no reason to punish him for it. Let’s spend our energy doing some good, rather than seeking revenge simply because this particular case offends us personally.

"The thing is, DPS output is not a constant average stream. There's high output times and low output times.

Hax claim is that during those low output times where you have no direct damage oGCDs or ammo up, the 30% gain is less than the loss you suffer from not having autoattacks.

So the idea is to stancedance, so GB is up during high pot/GCD moments, and off during low pot/GCD moments. It's hard to do, and I also haven't been able to find real good info on the swap timings, but it definitely has the potential to increase the overall DPS output, and it likely also does so for BRD.

You can't really say that ""it's not worth it to toogle on/off"", since there's no payoff. It's simply a matter of stance dancing being harder than not stance dancing, but if you do it right, you gain DPS and mobility without losing anything.

Now the tricky part is that when you turn it on, it takes 15 secs before you can turn it off again. But my guess will be that the trick will be something with turning it on as gauss round gets ready, then fire gauss, keep barrel on for 20 secs and turn it off right after next gauss round."

"It may look like there is a ton of sidewalk but please don't park there ever again. You are lucky you only got a ticket. The building manager could have had you towed without warning... and that is really expensive.

Pro tips if you are looking for parking -

- Just down the street at 9th and Grant is a parking lot for the Denver Public Schools building. It is legal to park there on weekends and I believe evenings. 

- Much of Logan opens up for parking on the left hand side after a certain hour / weekends

- Always look at least block or two away from the 10 story condos around the place pictured. Always tricky because a ton of people live in those buildings and not all have parking spots.  

- Even at 12 at night, there is someone pulling their car out somewhere within a few blocks. It is a pretty active area. You can't give up looking after just a few minutes if you are relying on public spots to park. 

- Always more likely to find a space on a street with houses over a street with apartments

- Rent a space if you want the luxury of owning a car around capitol hill without having to be a master at parallel parking. I say luxury because that is what it is to own a car, you are never entitled to a space like the one you chose just because you own a car. There is always another option, even if seemingly inconvenient. "

I have fond memories of following summons around in Chameleon form, and if they made it all the way through the gauntlet, popping out and fighting them. Felt like a human controlled mini boss fight, and it's great fun watching people fall for traps which you set up. 

It's a pity the covenant wasn't well received from most people since it was too easy to exploit (the majority just ganked mercilessly with the PvE enemies) so I don't think it'll pop up in Dark Souls 3. Hope an equivalent will though, preferably with more creative traps, since it was great fun while it was fresh."

"""Google and Microsoft laugh at ad revenues...""

Microsoft is made up of multiple billion dollar businesses and certainly isn't an ad revenue centric company. But Google? Are you trolling? 

 In 2014, Google's ad revenue amounted to almost 59.06 billion US dollars. That year, advertising accounted for 89.5 percent of the online company's total revenues.

In what universe do you live in where you think Google would laugh at essentially their entire existence?"

"Because everyone (or nearly everyone) competing for the attention of simply the largest demographic is not an efficient economic strategy. When 90% of the focus is on a 64% demographic, the competition per-capita is 5 times higher than the minority demographics. The rational strategy would be to invest your efforts towards the underrepresented demographics, because lower competition means those efforts will be more successful despite the smaller size of the target market."

1. I honestly don't know. It was extremely painful to eat 1000 calories a day. I don't think I would ever want to stop eating. I'm not sure if this is ethical to try and find out, even in animals. 

2. This is not my area of total expertise, but I have read that we have experienced a massive genetic shift in the last 50ish years that has taken the starvation response of storing/creating fat from something only a few people experienced to now a majority. Especially in western countries. 

3. Again, not my area of expertise but the change in weight genetics has correlated (I believe) with the change in height genetics so this is far from an unprecedented ""rapid"" change. 

4. This one I know for certain, research shows over and over again that only 1-5% of people can lose weight.  So even for people who don't have my particular genetic coding, MOST people can't lose weight. Even on calorie restrictions, they may not gain, but they won't lose weight either. "

"I haven't found any other places reporting this yet besides the bbc. This is what Israel considers a ""crack down"" on settler terrorism: *ignoring settler attacks for decades, allowing settlers to have complete immunity from the law; then following the burning of a Palestinian toddler Israel authorities pretend to care by acting as if that arson attack was some ""exceptional occurrence""; then they claim they are investigating this attack by using draconian measures such as administrative detention and illegal interrogation methods, resulting in the detainment of 7 individuals including administrative detention for 3 of them; despite this several settler attacks still occurred within the West Bank during this same time period; then finally releasing these settlers (terrorists)...* What's next from here? 

Israel is enforcing inequality in the West Bank, plain and simple. The disturbing part is that Israel's policies are clearly deliberate and she knows exactly what she is doing. Nobody is being fooled. To Israel Palestinian lives are cheap and Jewish lives are superior by law. Even worse this inequality Palestinians face at the hands of Israelis is being enforced *within* Palestine...

Think about it.... In the Untied States you have an entire country rising against American police corruption, brutality, and inequality in enforcement towards minorities. Meanwhile in Palestine by law Palestinians and Jews are not equal; yes I said **by law.** Denying Palestinians their basic rights and treating Jewish settlers as superior *in Palestine.* That's what is happening. I may sound repetitive but it's the only way to get my point across. "

"The Kepler Syndrome is so painfully real, and people don't seem to think about the fact that if we start taking out satellites, pretty soon NO ONE will be able to launch them. The 'buildup of debris' is practically a footnote in this article but it's by far the most glaring consequence of space-based militarization. There's no practical way to protect satellites against debris moving several kilometers per second. We NEED an international standard for launching satellites that requires each one to either be able to boost itself to a graveyard orbit or kick itself into a decaying orbit once its purpose has been served. If we don't, LEO is going to become too dangerous to even send astronauts THROUGH it. We could effectively lock ourselves on Earth's surface. Think about it"

The way humans and other species tend to deal with catastrophes is to actually have more offspring and ensure the survival of the species. 

People not wanting kids is more likely similar to why people want to own homes less these days; economic precarity. When people can barely support themselves it's logical that they're not going to want to take on a dependant. 

Also worth remembering that overpopulation isn't killing the planet. We produce enough food for every human to eat well and we have environmentally safe energy production ready to go."

Sorry penguin powers to op.
"I'm saying the average consumer's reason for buying an iPhone isn't one reason. If the phone looked the same and had the same logo but with a shitty laggy OS, nobody would want an iPhone. The CPU, camera and RAM are certainly factors people consider when buying a phone, but it's certainly not the only ones. 

You can buy a fake battery operated Rolex for $50 while the real thing costs $10,000. But the real one is made of gold and has kinetic movement, not a battery. The two watches *look* the same and the knockoff has Rolex's branding, so if that's the only reason for buying a watch, then get the $50 one. But that doesn't mean the $10,000 one isn't worth its price. 

&gt; And yes, the OS is greatly optimized, but clearly that's not hard to do anymore.

Then why is the knockoff slower than the original with fewer features? "
"The 9point8 fall line looks pretty awesome doesn't it? Except the price tag...but if it actually works reliably it would likely end up being cheaper than most of the others over a couple of years of not having to rebuild it all the time!

Haven't pulled the trigger on a dropper yet due to the price/reliability issues. Don't know anyone yet that has a dropper that has not had what I would consider unacceptable reliability issues for something that costs as much as these do."
"You say that, but remember you just listed 5 nuclear-related problems.  Though I'm not sure Hiroshima belongs on the list, although I guess it does demonstrate what nuclear power can do.  But one of those events happened just a few years ago.  And I fully believe another one will happen in the future.  Earthquakes and tsunamis happen.  Human error happens.  Computer and machine error happen.  Things go wrong.  And the problem with nuclear power plants, is that when enough goes wrong, people die and entire towns/regions are destroyed for generations.  Now I happen to live near one and never really even think about it, let alone worry- in middle and high school we'd even go there for field trips- but I don't discount people who are afraid of playing with fire.  Yes, its extremely safe, and there are tons of safety measures in place, and multiple things in a row have to go wrong for something really bad to happen.  But its already happened multiple times in the 60 years nuclear power has been around, and the more we build, the more chance there is for something to go wrong.  You can say ""oh that was human error"" or ""something was missed on an inspection"" or whatever, but that's the real world.  No matter how safe something is in theory, things go wrong in reality.

I guess if I was really forced to come down on a side, I'd still be pro-nuclear power.  I'm just saying its naive to think nothing will ever go wrong with it.  And when things go wrong with nuclear power, results can be catastrophic. "
"First off, I drive into Mexico to get to my hometown, so no, it's not always safe to get there-- carjacking is common in certain parts of Mexico. Second, just because I don't live in Mexico doesn't mean I've revoked my ability to have an opinion on my country. Also, Mexico will never get out of this unless people fight and stand up for themselves, and demand better from their people and politicians. You can't just sit on your hands and hope for the better. ""The least thing we want is more bloodshed."" Yeah, so what's the alternative? We just let everyone who has money and influence step all over us? Mexico will never improve if its people don't stand up and demand for change. "

(Prices are obviously hypothetical, the point is that someone could come in at any time and offer the Galaxy more money than they are expecting, and buy him from the club. This could literally happen any time the transfer window is open and that is the fear that people are mumbling about.)"

Yes.  It is very nice to donate money to political groups that prey upon the parent of young gay kids, convince said parents that ""god"" can help their kids overcome gayness, and then puts the kids thru psychological torture to ""re-orient"" them.

"The problem with that is that the true cost of the Olympics is never known in advance. 

Hell, it's not even clear in retrospect. Look at London, where they're still debating how much the 2012 Olympics actually cost the city.

The key problem is that there aren't simply clear facts about the costs for giant projects like this. There are a ton of judgement calls  as to what counts as what sort of cost, what spending would have happened anyway vs. what was spent solely on account of the games, etc.. These all get baked into the final ""factual"" account of costs.

Taking London as an example again, they did a bunch of upgrades to the transit infrastructure around the sports complexes. Some experts say these should all be considered non-sports related infrastructure improvements. Others say some of the improvements were only needed to handle the events crowds, and therefore should be considered sports-related. Now you have a battle of the experts, and the public is largely in the dark about how much should be considered long-term investment in transit vs. money spent just on the Olympics. "

"Comrade Petroy give all to Motherland. He respect quota. He not expect more kopeks for less work.

After life of achievement, he still try find more communism to spread. He take to attack capitalist pigs. For doing this, he start patrolling neighbourhood of communal living space E45 at night.

But at first he wear red clothes (was award for good service to Motherland but since Petroy is poor is only clothes). Red clothes are visible at night when is hunt for capitalist pigs. So Petroy buy black clothes to be less visible. But he still not find capitalist pigs. 

He look at shoes and find that are metal-toed (was award for filling quota at uranium mine). Metal shine in light at night. So Petroy sell shoes, and with profit buy black shoes that not shine in night.

But he still not find capitalist pigs! So Petroy do unthinkable, he steal from work to buy hoodie for clothes. He think that his eyes shine in anticipation of hunt so capitalist pigs must see eyes and take fear and run.

One night Petroy finally see action, he see car come from corner of street. 'Finally!' is think. 'Is capitalist pig, for only rich is able to afford car!'.

But instead of capitalist pig come KGB agents from out of car. They arrest Petroy and drag to boot of car. Before they slam trunk, Petroy say 'but, I am hunt capitalist pigs!'. KGB say, 'No Petroy, you are capitalist pig'."

"I play this game several hours a week, and I strongly strongly disagree. The Nightfalls is are just a level playthrough, and at this point you only die due to glitches and just feel dragged out (especially like this week with no burns). Especially because they rotate through what is seemingly the same damn nightfalls every other week (Seriously I've faced Tanniks at least 18 times in 2 months across the 3 characters in Nightfalls)

My preferred method is to partner with a woman then show off *just to* her by dancing with her really well.  "

If a man gets in a bad situation he can receive instruction on how to avoid it next time.

Again, you can tell a man not to go to a dangerous place, act in a dangerous way. You cannot tell a woman this.

You may not like that, but that is how it is.

A man may temporarilly become a victim and therefore can carry responsability for decisions that led to being in an abusive relationship. He can learn from those decisions and avoid it in the future.

A woman is a victim, and expecting her to learn from previous bad decisions puts an unfair burden on her and in effect blams HER for what happens TO HER.

I am not saying it needs to be, or should be this way. I am saying that in our culture right now that is how it is, that is the reality of our society at this moment. It *should* change, but until that does you cannot blame the victim."

"Still think this will be an interesting auction for the following reasons:

1) Sprint hasn't finished their expansion they started in 2013.  Adding more spectrum or changing plans will continue delaying their build out

2) AT&amp;T is potentially cash-scrapped after their DirectTV merger.

3) Verizon has publicly stated that they might sit it out (though they'll buy some in select areas IMO).

4) AT&amp;T and Verizon and Dish spent a huge sum of money in the last auction; they might not have the debt financing capabilities for this upcoming one

What's riding on TMo is how much financing they can get.  I hope lenders are lining up and giving them good offers, because the brand and growth is on fire.

"This is basically /u/HeraclitusZ 's answer, but a bit more formal and gets rid of the distribution of points ambiguity:

[The answer is 1/4 if the points are picked from ANY probability distribution which is invariant under a 180 degree rotation about the origin. We also have the slightly technical condition (\*): Any line through the origin has measure 0.](#sp)

[So a proof: Let A denote the event that the three randomly chosen points x1, x2, x3 create a triangle enclosing the origin, and B the event that r(x1), x2, x3 create such a triangle, where r(x1) is the rotation of x1 around the origin by 180 degrees. By our assumption we have P(A) = P(B).](#sp)

[Now, fix x1 and x2, and draw the lines through x1 and the origin, and x2 and the origin. By condition (\*) we can assume x1 and x2 are not on the origin, and also not equal to each other. Now these lines divide the plane into four wedges. Again by condition (\*), we can assume x3 lies in the interior of one of the wedges and not on the boundary. Triangle x1, x2, x3 contains the origin if and only if x3 is in the wedge opposite x1 and x2, and r(x1), x2, x3 contains the origin if and only if x3 is in the wedge opposite x2 but adjacent to x1. These two wedges combine to form the half-plane region opposite x2, which has probability measure 1/2 because of the rotational invariance of our distribution. So P(A) + P(B) = 1/2, which implies P(A) = P(B) = 1/4.](#sp)"

"I've read this article a few times, and maybe I am missing a key point, but it does not seem like they are about to initiate some master plan to force minorities into special operations.  They presented facts and some quotes from some informed people that address the issue.  From what I read, the concern seems to be more about being able to appeal to a wider foreign audience when going into a country; increasing operational capability.  A lot of people will read this article and get squeamish because it talks about race and their dear old military.  The writer states a few times that it is based on a lack of desire by the minorities to join these units,  not a symptom of overt racism or bias.  I think any reasonable person will agree that they would not want any special treatment or programs to get minorities in, but I see nothing wrong with informing us of a lack of diversity.  "

There's usually a couple screws and then the rotor goes over the axle nut, which holds the hub (where the wheel studs are attached to) and bearing down to the axle. They can be pretty rusted on, so you might have to bang with a hammer, or hit it with some PB blaster"

"You can probably salvage the world 1 tendency events. Boot up the game connected to the internet, log in with that character, enter world 1, exit to the Nexus, and then log out. Do that a few more times and that should get your WT to one shade below pure white in world 1 as every time you log in it moves your WT one shade closer to the server average (which is usually white). 

Alternatively, if you have enough stones of EE to get your body form back (at least 7), begin the game in offline mode (log out of PSN and then boot up the game), kill yourself in body form in world 1 6-7 times, until you get pure black world tendency. Note: changes to world tendency don't post to the world until you exit it and return to the Nexus. Do the two pure black tendency events (once you kill one of them, make sure not to return to the Nexus until you kill the other one), and killing both of those enemies will put you to one step below pure white.

Once you have done either of those methods start the game in offline mode. if you are in body form, kill yourself in the Nexus. Beat the last boss in world 1, exit to the Nexus, and World 1 should now be in pure white world tendency. 

DO NOT boot the game up in online mode until you do all the PWWT events as it will shift it down to 1 shade below pure white when you login with that character."

"I definitely think that men are the least oppressed or stigmatized in nearly all the most important ways, but men are generally repressed in very different ways to others. Mostly rigidity of available actions and extreme pressure to perform. I think most people are pretty out of tune with both how men and women are repressed. If one were to be so regarding women but be highly sensitive to men than that's how you end up there. I would hope that someone interested in gender issues wouldn't be tribal and would empathize with other groups, but honestly I'm frequently disappointed with feminists in this regard as well. For example, vilifying men for their sexual impulses and calling them pigs instead of sympathizing with someone experiencing something beyond their control. I try to remember that most humans are shit at this kind of empathy and that I shouldn't expect too much. The human handicap is a large one, we're keen to forget that. "

"The problem is getting it to not happen, and how that happens would have a huge effect on European history, which is also going to effect the civilization of the Old World. It's not what would have happened to the old world if American contact never happened, but what would have happened to the old world if whatever happened to prevent American contact had happened.

Just getting rid of Columbus isn't enough, you also have to stop Portuguese exploration as well as fishermen who'd already reached the Grand Banks, as both of these groups were bound to find the Americas eventually (if they hadn't already). Then you have to prevent any other curious Europeans, and probably Africans and Asians for that matter, from finding it later, and continuing to prevent this contract for the centuries to come.

It is fun to speculate on all this though."

There are a lot of them out there. If you're going away for a week, you usually would want someone to come and change water at least once or twice, and maybe feed something like an adult beardie once or twice.  If I need someone to do this for me, I usually make sure I have some superworms on hand, since people are less squeamish about them than crickets or roaches."

"Please forgive me if I'm misinterpreting your comments, but it seems to me that you view the Bible as the words of men - rather than the words of God.  It colors the way you view what you read in it.  E.g., ""it was for this reason that the leaders in Israel encouraged procreation"" - to me, that indicates that you feel like the laws in the Bible were created and put in place by men (i.e., ""the leaders in Israel"").  A viewpoint like that is going to change the way you read things in the Bible.  It would cause you to discount the teachings contained in the books written by Paul, because you'd see them as Paul's words rather than God's.

The Bible writers aren't the authors of the Bible.  They're just the writers - God is the author.  It's like a boss dictating to a secretary.  I know some are incredulous at that though (""Hah, yeah, how naive to think it was God that wrote the Bible instead of men.  Stupid""), but the consistency and harmony of the Bible proves it to me.  God's authorship of the Bible is proven to me by the Bible itself.  There's no way it was authored by men.  "

"Fuck, that *hurt*.


Atmospheric re-entry hurts like a bitch, even if you're immortal. Turns out that reaching terminal velocity in the upper atmosphere makes you pretty hot under the collar. 


*AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA* 


Sorry, I've had literal millennium to come up with awful jokes like that. 


I've got no idea where I am. I think I forgot who I was, to begin with. I've been immortal since the 21st century, and humanity didn't even go extinct until somewhere in the mid 1500th. Maybe the 1555th? Its been a while. Maybe I'm going for a nice number that has a lot of fives in it. I've always liked fives. And tens. And even numbers. Or maybe it was the mid 2500th century. Or 25000th. Whatever, not a big deal. Its probably been longer than that. 


But I digress. Where the hell am I anyway? What sort of awful barren wasteland do I need to sit down on until it get consumed by its own sun like the last time?


Wait.


Waaaaaaait a minute.


I can breathe here. Which is shocking, because humans weren't really designed to breathe in pure nothing in the deep vacuum of space, and most atmospheres are too thin to support us. 


Or made of sulfur or something which sucks a surprising amount, let me tell you. Tell me. Let me tell me? I don't know. This rambling inside my head is getting obnoxious. I feel like one of those old comic book characters, from the 20th century. What was his name? Deadlake? Livepuddle? Ryan Reynolds? Whatever.


I vigorously shake my head to return myself to reality.


Huh. I feel like the hot should have subsided by now. My feet are still pretty hot though. I look down and notice that I appear to be partially submerged in magma. I can only assume I didn't notice earlier because my nerve endings are pretty much burnt to a crisp. Nice. As I pull myself out of the lava pool and my nerve endings reconstruct themselves - in screaming bloody pain, by the way - along with the rest of my body, I look up. 


It's clear skies, here. I see stars. Assholes, the lot of them. Eating up my planet. I think I see a few white dwarves. Fuck those guys. All small and shit, influencing the heat death of the universe. Should that have happened by now? I don't do time much anymore. 


Ok, my legs are back to being legs, I think. This volcano really is quite hot. I see the rim. Well, time to see what fresh hell I've been dropped into. As I stand up I turn around and look at the man-shaped crater in the ground behind me. Wile E. Coyote would have been proud.


Forty minutes later, I'm raging quietly to myself. ""Fuck... This... Shit..."" I mutter as I climb over the rock fixtures to the edge of the volcano. It's the first time I've heard my voice in millennium. It sounds so strange and foreign to me. 


Everything hits me all at once as I pull myself up on top of the edge of the precipice. Here's the thing about space. Its a vacuum, right? So it's boring. It has no sound. No smells. Nothing.


I can hear things.


I can smell things.


As I stand up on the rim of the volcano I've landed in, I see vast kilometers of treeline stretched before me. I see flowing rivers and deep lakes. I smell fresh air for the first time in millennium. 


I see something else. Far, in the distance.


Tears begin to stream down my face. So long. I've been searching for so long. Alone for so long.


I begin to run. I run through day and night. I see creatures I don't recognize, and some that I thought I would never see again. 


I run.


Finally, after days and nights of running forever forward, I approach the gate.


The men standing outside peer curiously at me through their uniformed visors.


""Hello?"" I say. I hope against hope that English is still spoken. ""Bonjour?"" ""Ciao?"" ""Tere?"" ""Salam?"" I continue to go through which languages come to mind. I learned them all in another place, in another time. 


One of the men moves forward towards my naked figure, covered with cuts and bruises. My eyes must be wild, after so long.


""Hello, stranger. Who might you be?"" He responds.


Finally, I am home again.

And it's not in the report because we didn't think -- at that point in time, the intercepted ball because nobody knew whether or not the Colts might have tampered with it or something, we didn't use that as part of the analysis.  Later on after the fact, I don't know if it was the Patriots or somebody said, well, you could have used that ball as data that maybe the gauges were off, what have you.  But the fact is that Riveron told us he tested it three times.  I forget what the numbers are.  And he used both of the gauges.""

Your gold ancients are underleveled. Bring them to ~427 and Siya to 459. Raise Iris to 103 and Morgulis to ~231k. Otherwise you're doing good. Just keep gaining HS. The goal of the mid/end-game is (mostly) to regild further down the rangers. Next ranger for you is Phthalo which becomes optimal about 800-1000 Siya.

I also tend to treat cloud storage as I would treat a postcard.  Nothing goes there that I wouldn't have a problem with anyone seeing.

I keep software system disks necessary for my work on cloud, so that if I need them I have access to them, but I require data for these things to work anyway - thus the cloud.  I also use cloud storage as a temporary medium to transfer large amounts of data from one location to another, but this is rarely necessary to do with my phone.

As I said, the SD card gives me options.  Removing it takes away those options.  Going back a number of years, my old BlackBerry 8900 ceased working.

I haven't even left the counter of the store yet.  I can't do that with cloud in any reasonable time frame, or at no cost."

"I may be going against the grain here a little but I wanted to chime in my thoughts after running my team for a few years now.

I used to run 9F 4D but I found that the forwards were (as mentioned by other posters), spending more time sitting than playing, so I cut the roster down to 10 skaters and 1 goalie, so two full D and two full forward lines. I use BenchApp to keep track of attendance and when players notify me that they're going to miss a game, I ask one of my reliable spares to fill in. I only use the same 4 or 5 spares so that their games count towards playoff eligiblity.

I never understood having so many skaters registered for a team because managing that many players reliably and efficiently is very difficult. It took me a few seasons but I was able to get a great group of guys that are reliable enough to tell me when they're not going to attend a game. Once in a while a guy sleeps through the game or gets stuck at work, but with BenchApp (no I don't work for them lol), it's been fairly easy to manage my roster.

With 10 skaters our winter season is costing 600 bucks per person (about 20 bucks a game), so I'm not sure what the costs are for other areas (I'm in Ottawa, Canada).

Some common objections to my way of managing the team that I've heard before:

    It's not easy to find reliable guys that have the right skillset we need for our team

You're absolutely right. It took me almost 3 or 4 seasons to find reliable guys that weren't dicks and got along with everyone else. Obviously every situation is different but I was very careful in who joined the team and I find that helps me manage my roster so much better because I don't have to worry about guys randomly not showing up.

    The cost is too high with only 10 skaters!

This also may be true in a lot of cases, but I've been able to subsidize the cost by charging spares 10 or 15 bucks (and not a single person has ever objected) to play. As I mentioned before, I usually use the same set of spare players to cover missing roster players, but everyone gets along so no one ever minds paying a few bucks to play with a good group of guys in an organized setting. The cost is equivalent to a pickup game, so that helps.

    Does using an app to manage your team really help?

I used to text the guys a few days before the game and pester people for responses and it was very time consuming on my behalf. With the app I use, it emails everyone at 4 days before the game and again 2 days before. Anyone who hasn't checked in by then (sometimes 1 or 2 guys), I send a quick text to and that usually gives me enough time to find a spare if they can't attend.

"&gt; Having a system that rewards you with queue prioritise, same ""polite-level"" gamers

Chris Sigaty and Alan Dabiri from Blizzard said on a recent interview they want to do this on Hots.

http://stevivor.com/2015/07/interview-blizzards-chris-sigaty-and-alan-dabiri-on-heroes-of-the-storm/

&gt; When you are talking about a rewards system, it is something we have discussed where we can introduce some way that will allow the players to police themselves. So when you come out of a game you can basically rate the other people that you play with, “You know this other player was really cool, he told me some tips. Even though I screwed up he was all cool and said don’t worry about it. Ultimately we came back and we won, and so I give him my kudos, I give him my thumbs up.” If enough people are kind of saying this guy is good maybe we give him some kind of bonuses, we give him some kind of honourable bonus whether its XP, gold, or whatever that might be. So whatever motivatates or encourages people to be positive in the game, not because it’s just the right thing to do but because they will be rewarded for it as well.  Then on the flip side if you come out of a game and “this person was very negative and they were harassing me and I give them the thumbs down,” we can then take action there too. There’s like a wide gambit of action we can take, one of them is we might just go, “Okay you know what this guy is a little more aggressive, he has a different tone to what we are used to, we’re going to take him and put him with other people who are also like that”. It’s like; okay you can play, and that’s your style of play but a lot of people don’t like the way you’re playing. They don’t like it when you start yelling at people. But you know what, other people who do like that, we’re going to have you go play with them. We’re going to have you get together with those guys. We are actually already doing this right now with the leaver system, where if you leave a game we will let you keep on playing but right now you’re going to be matched up with other people who like to leave the game. And as a result if that’s what you like to do, you don’t like to stick with it and battle through that game, well maybe there’s other people who will want to do that as well."

"Now do you want some real advice instead of the cookie cutter ""see a therapist"" bullshit? Stop everything you're currently doing. Start working on yourself. Go lift, get in shape, make yourself as attractive as possible. Stop doing things for her when she does nothing for you in return. You're a provider, and that's all she sees you as because that's all you're giving her. She locked you down with marriage and sex and now sees the endless ATM that you've become. 

And I hate to be the guy to tell you this as I've been in your shoes before, but there is a very, very, very strong chance that if she's going out w/ her friends 3 nights a week, that they aren't always her ""girlfriends"". If she isn't already cheating on you, she's thinking about it, or has someone in mind, or will when the chance arises. I've seen this scenario a thousand times, and have been in it myself a handful, it is almost ALWAYS this way. 

Stop living your life to please her, because she's not doing shit to please you. Start lifting, start becoming more social. Start talking to women, if you can't bring it to yourself to actually sleep with one then at nothing else do it to make her jealous that you're able to get someone else's attention. Do this stuff and I guarantee she starts getting a little more attentive and sweet to you, which is a trap yet again. 

If I were you I'd kick her to the curb, but if you really want to stay with her (and I have no idea why any self respecting man would) then that's how you do it. "

"For a Durga team, I'd go with Durga/Zuoh/Dark Dragon Knight/Hadar/Flex. Hadar drops from Mechdragon's Massive Fortress, which is easier than Starlight Sanctuary in my experience (just watch out for binds). That gives you a 25x team with a dark TPH focus.

Your other option is to play into the sparkleboard meta. You have Gamble Mage, Grape Dragon, and Chibi Pandora, each of which has three dark orb enhance awakenings. That's a 45% damage boost for every dark combo before you even count the individual orb combos or the other three monsters on your team, and every dark orb that drops will be enhanced. cPandora/Gamble Mage/Grape Dragon/Haku/Vampire would give you a lot of dark makers, a lot of dark orb enhancers, and a decent mult.

Edit: Grape dragon only has two dark enhances. My Bad."

"It is not 1500 to fly from Japan to Brisbane more like half or even a third of that price depending on the day, I can fly from Brisbane to Los Angeles for around 1000 and Japan is a lot closer.  Hell I can get to Hawaii for under $400.

Travelling to any more than 2 GPs a year, requires flights and the prices add up.  Being an island nation has those sorts of drawbacks.  You can't just drive from Australia to any other country for example when they had the GP Auckland in New Zealand this year that left 1 GP in Australia total."

"&gt;To be honest, Asatru is kind of a joke. I was recently communicating with the chair of the archeology department at the University of Uppsala, Sweden, and he told me that no one takes Asatru seriously in academia in Scandinavia. According to him, about 95% of Asatru is completely made up. Hardly any of it is based on real evidence of Viking practices via artifacts or literature. Figuring he's pretty much the ""top dog"" of modern Viking digs, I'll take his word for it.

Replace this with any ""pagan"" religions and it would still be accurate. "

"As secv808 said, the primary issue is the color. I'll try not to repeat what he said, but rather give some techniques and background on how to achieve that.

In the real world, highlights on an object tend to be brighter, but less saturated. Shadows tend to be darker and more saturated. However, the light usually isn't the same color as the object, meaning there will be some hue differences in the highlights and shadows vs. the midtones. Lets use our Earth's Sun as a reference here. It casts a yellow/orange light. If you shift the hue of your highlights to be a little more yellow, it adds interest to the piece. Though the shadows don't receive any light, they are still shifted by the color of the light. If the highlights shift yellow, then the shadows will shift towards yellow's compliment, which is blue/violet. The compliment will make both the shadows and highlights pop more. I see that you made a pre-determined color palette, and that's a fine workflow for people who have already spent a lot of time designing some really nice color schemes. I personally advocate for starting with just a single base midtone color, and modulating it as you go along. The colors always look different on the final piece than they do in your mind beforehand. Also, starting from on basic midtone lets you more easily hue shift the highlights and shadows to make it all feel more related. 

I'm not super familiar with GIMP, but a few huge parts of my workflow in Photoshop are Levels/Curves Adjustments, Hue/Saturation Adjustments, and the Brightness/Contrast Adjustments. These tools let me quickly hammer out the pixel placements and get the textures/dithering right, then tweak the color and value relationships until they're perfect at the end. Use levels to balance the shadows/midtones/highlights universally. Shifting the hue lets me test different color schemes extremely quick without destroying the value or color relations. Messing with the saturation and contrast is a great final thing, because sometimes just a little nudge up in both can make a huge difference, just don't overdo it. 

I did a quick paintover on your piece, maybe it will help you understand a little better how to put these ideas into action. Warning: I did this in like 10 mins, so it isn't perfect, but you can see the difference just a little tweaking makes in visual impact.

"You brought up job and education I think it has nothing to do with this debate I just answered your question but I will leave it here since it contributes nothing to this.

Actually my behavior, if you read my post, was saying that I think money should go towards government structured support and welfare and that handing it out on the streets means you help the most visible not the most needy.

And I quote;

&gt;**Look, I think we need to offer the homeless support and not victimise them but maybe the evidence is here showing that random donations are not going to do this and we need to have systematic government policy in place to allow this to happen and for the help to fall into the right hands.** This article does not necessarily at all have right wing implications. I actually see it from a left point of view which is **give people the appropriate support on a regulated basis instead of random hand outs that may not actually be as beneficial.**

This is also what the charity said, that a lot of beggers are not legitimate and hence my points. 

To suggest this is unbecoming of my profession well, no. I merely suggested that we don't hand out money on the street we actually improve our welfare state so that this is not required as a source of income. Evidence here suggested why this point may be there.

You don't have to ""take my word for it."" Look through my post history and I will happily back up further claims but if you think somebody with a medical history or respiratory interest has looked through IPF drugs not licensed even in Europe yet I think you may be clutching at straws. Anything else I'd happily back it and prove it up further because people often like to through education around on here until they realise some people may actually be on an academic perspective highly achieving also. Hence people like to lie well as I said, I happily back up what I say although I do often delete comments were doxxing can occur due to the sensitive nature of the profession.

I have care about my statements but the fact is I actually suggested a point of view that does not demonise the poor at all. I think you have it that the who post these articles are right wing assholes who want to demonise the poor. If you read what I said again you may actually realise I posted this to get debate, see what others thought but you immediately started name calling and the such when I never called into question your personal attributes until you started insulting me.

The quotes I posted here and bolded for you paint another side to the story. I do think you may have good intentions but you are so desperate to attack the poor bashing Tories you flame anybody and everybody.
For your interest I didn't vote Tory and from a medical background it pisses me off they cut ILF. It makes no sense on an academic, principlistic or moral point of view or even from a financial aspect.

Read what I said and chill out a bit, I appreciate your tone here and the apology sincerely so thank you for that. "

"This is something that should be **infinitely** upvoted. One of the biggest challenges that humanity faces today, aside from our complete negligence of our habitat/ecosystems, and our drive to kill one another over petty religious beliefs and insatiable greed, is the lack of acceptance of **FACTS**. Evolution is real. That is a fact. In my opinion, we were not created in the image of some ""divine deity."" We are the current step in the amazing evolutionary chain of life on this planet. To have somebody preach that we are only here because of the work of some great man in the sky that created all of us in his image, is ridiculous, and a slap in the face. We are here because of billions of years of evolution and natural selection. If everyone would just accept that as the **FACT** it is, and quit trying to deceive young minds into thinking it's all just some game of life where you have to live your entire life a certain way JUST to get into a ""Heaven"", the world would be a much, much better place. This is all in my honest opinion of course. :D"

"Sales is not a nice guys business. I can not stress that enough. You have a job to do, and you need to get paid. People need to be marks to you, potential dollars in the bank, and you need to try everything you can to make every sale. I understand you don't want to be a dodgy salesman, but there is a difference between telling a lie and making a sale. 

I used to be in sales, and one of the hardest things to do is close a deal. Learn to overcome excuses people give you to not buy, apply a gentle pressure, if they call you on your tactics, reply with something like ""without pressure we wouldn't have diamonds, now would we?"" There is a book called 'The One Minute Closer' by J. Pickens I suggest you read, I got my copy to read from the local library. It has a lot of lines and points to help sell in it. 

Ask questions during your pitch that aren't really questions at all. What I mean is, the answer to these questions should be determined before you ask, for example: ""You wanna feel that bass rock your ribs together don't you?"" and after they answer, reassert their answer: ""Yeah! And trust me, chicks love it!"" Doing this over the course of your presentation will put them in that 'yes' mindset. When it comes time to close, don't ask them if they want to take one home, say something like: ""Alright, sounds good, lets head over to my desk/register and we'll do some paperwork/ I'll ring you up.""

Don't ask people if they need help, engage them in conversation and subtly find out what they are looking for, then take command of the situation. 

Smile! SMILE ALL THE TIME! Along those lines, dress nicely. People are far more likely to buy from someone who is well dressed, that is a fact. 

Don't give up and don't get discouraged! You aren't going to sell everyone. Some people are rude, stubborn, and all around unpleasant. Those are the worst people to work with, but you just gotta try harder with them. Think of it this way. If they are going to be rude no matter what, why should you be courteous to them? Whip out the big guns and call them on their shit! Whats the worst that could happen? They don't buy from you? They weren't going to in the first place. Make that side handed comment! Say you are selling computers...older guy comes in, doesn't wanna buy a fancy touchscreen windows 10 laptop. You can talk about the awesome features until you are blue in the face, and he won't buy. BUT if you say something like ""Whats the matter old man, you wanna be stuck in the past forever?"" Is that rude? Ehhh...yeah, kind of, sure, but it got his attention, and maybe he is willing to listen now. If not, no ground really lost. 

Something to remember, people will find a way to pay for things they want before things they need. Think of all the people driving around without insurance that have fucking HBO at home. Make them want what you have and they will buy. Trust me. "

"&gt; And do you feel there are any discernable advantages to having a million different crucible playlists over having private matches?

Quite frankly, I'd love having both!

Overall however, custom games would be the best thing that could happen to this game at the moment (well, next to getting the re-balance patch sooner).

A big advantage would be the matchmaking part of having all playlists available at all times. Sure, they might not have the biggest pool of players, but you'll still see _some_ variety in players, whereas in a private game, the roster will be locked until someone leaves.

But other than that, I see no apparent advantages! I just hope we'd get a sub running for hosting private lobbies."

I wasn't really clear on what was going to change in their coverage. I wouldn't write them off just yet until you actually hear a difference. in the podcast.

Of course, the first episode was all about SEC media days, so it's maybe not fair to judge the tenor of the new-name podcast just by the first episode. I'll be interested to listen to their next few and see if it's more SEC-centered than before. That would be pretty disappointing, because I really liked the Eye on CFB podcast."

"Being open to homeschooling and having a location-neutral income source opens up a ton of doors, both in the US and elsewhere.

US: 

The Jersey Shore. Currently in a local depression because of casino closings, but plenty of bargains.

North Florida: Some very cheap towns that are generally open to outsiders. Jimmy Buffett Caribbean vibe.

Coastal AL/MS/LA: Even cheaper, but higher taxes and generally a more old South/hick population.

Coastal GA/SC/NC: Similar to the Gulf South with pockets of Florida-like resorts.

Overseas:

Portugal: Cheap because the economy is bad. If you don't need a local job, you can have a very first world lifestyle on that income, even in Lisbon. Dunno about migration permits if you have a fixed income.

The Caribbean, Central America, parts of SE Asia like the Philippines: Many of these countries will rubber stamp a visa for someone with a fixed income. Schools and services vary widely.

Goa: India's hippie mecca. Beaches and neat history but dunno about the cost of living, although India in general is cheap. Also look into Kerala and possibly beach towns in nearby countries like Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.

Africa: Lots of cheap beach towns. Nice ones can be in Tanzania, Mozambique, Cape Verde, rural South Africa, Namibia, Senegal, Gambia, Morocco. Busua in Ghana is supposedly cool if you don't mind surfers. Ed: Stay away from North Africa because of ISIS and instability."

It is at the beginning of your professional career. It is when you're living paycheck to paycheck. It is a huge deal when you can't afford rent, let alone another thousand dollars a month on top of it. It's immense when you're trying to provide for not only yourself but also your family because their minimum wage jobs aren't keeping the lights on.

Are you joking? Do you have that little understanding of how the majority of this country lives?

It's not just about college. It's about not having to overcome every single obstacle along the way, because they've been paved down for you. It's about not having to make the choice between abandoning your family and feeding your ambition.

"I mean, there's nothing wrong in going for the ""regular sports"" angle, the only problem is that you'll have to structure things the same way other sports do. That means arenas, sponsors, cult-followings etc. Now, RIOT is already well on their way. The problem still lies in the core of it all, the game. The fact that the game gets patched regularly, has bugs, has other issues, is in my opinion what keeps LoL from growing bigger than it is. The same goes for DotA or any other game, balancing is an important aspect that doesn't always work out.

Being a regular sport means that you have to find funding mainly from non-game related things, such as sponsorship deals. While the same holds true for DotA, at least the smaller tourneys can find some of the prize pool money via crowdfunding."

He'll just suddenly have huge sections of the story focusing on other characters, and it lasts long enough you get tied up in *their* story, only for it to all tie into the main character and what he's been up to since you last saw him. It's weird at first but I thought the payoff easily made up for it each time. Plus it helps give him a really unique storytelling style.

Unfortunately a story like that lends itself to longer formats like binge-reading manga. Some people think this makes the anime of Monster seem like it drags on, and I can't imagine waiting each week for the next chapter as it comes out.

That is not true attactiveness but the idea of having what you can't have. This has been researched alot of times, and time and time again, it show that many women gets interested when they figure out he is not available, but was totally uninterested when he was single. So that is not attractiveness, but the competetive female at their best."
"There seems to be a shift in the way the term has been used recently.  Traditionally, it has been, as you said, a mix of fantasy and horror (eg. stuff like Clive Barker's would be a good example).  Some people now seem to be applying it to ""grimdark"" / gritty fantasy as well though, which is a shame, because I think it's a useful category / distinction."

"I understand the need for some people to have the primary/secondary label, and that's fine. It's what works for them. I just don't subscribe to it for these reasons: I have multiple friendships. I don't like placing them on a rating scale of how important they are. I've also heard the same argument when it comes to having multiple children. Just some food for thought there. 
At any rate, you are right that time is not infinite. I generally get a feel for how much attention another partner needs after a few dates. It's been my experience that people that already have another partner (not necessarily their primary) don't need the everyday attention and are fine with once or twice a week. And, even in the case of the person only having one partner, they might still be ok with that sort of arrangement. In your case, you might suggest to Mike to have a conversation with Carly on how much time/attention she needs and go from there. "
"In competitive PvP, Titan~~s~~ (basically AEGabriel) actually tend to pick flashbang over lightning grenade.

Lightning grenade is great in pubstomps, but decent players simply walk out of it. furthermore, its dependency on architecture make it too situational for fast-paced play.

Tripmine is also dependent on architecture. You can sprint past it and not die, or you can put on a high armor build (Read: Ram) and live anyways. Doesn't really matter, because it only lasts like 15 seconds, so it's not like you can actually use it as a reliable trapping tool.

Defender has no showing in competitive play. Ruin wing is replaceable with a surplus sniper (with no usefulness in PvP) and saint 14 adds blinding to a class which has no competitive showing in PvP. I guess it blinds trash mobs in the abyss. But that's about it."

Hopefully you are right and the end result is a better balance of idols and underground artists. Without seeming crass the real benefit of Unpretty Rapstar existing was that it gave budding female hip hop artists a chance to shine and improve without them bowing out in the early rounds [as happens with many female contestants in SMTM]. As much as the drama which the show revolved around was unnecessary it gave artists like Kisum and Cheetah real tangible industry acclaim. I'll be a little disappointed if a lot of potential underground talent is shoehorned out for too many idols. I think we need a healthy mixture of the two groups.

Why did we lose?  Some idiot made the call to go back and defend.  Our Tychus who also had the Drakken laser went back and used his laser on the enemy Tychus along and our other main DPS was dead.  I was the only one actually hitting the core as Johanna.

"The audience had the run of the stages in the bad old days when I was touring. A lot of people got hurt and equipment damaged.

We used to have gear stolen when the stage would get rushed. We lost microphones, effects peddles and in one case a kid ran on, grabbed a prized rare guitar, ran all the way through the thrashing crowd and out the doors to the street, never to be seen again.

We never recovered the guitar, or any of the other gear.

We were early adopters of wireless technology because we were tired of our cables getting damaged and/or unplugged during our performances.

We had custom made mic stands that were difficult to knock over and the mics were heavily strapped on to avoid damage and theft.

There were many cases of people getting injured from falls off the stage or being injured from falling gear. 

Ambulances were at most shows.

Luckily we were never charged with anything, but venue owners or promoters were sued in a few cases.

I don't see how a band member could be charged in a case like this?"

"You can keep your drains clog-free and odorless by using the following homemade noncorrosive drain cleaner weekly. Combine 1 cup baking soda (use that old box from the frig), 1 cup table salt, and 1/4 cup cream of tartar. Stir ingredients together thoroughly and pour into a clean, covered jar. Pour 1/4 cup of mixture into drain, and immediately add 1 cup boiling water. Wait 10 seconds, then flush with cold water. Flushing weekly with a generous amount of boiling water also works well.

"The extreme nature of your opinion is making it seem like you're trolling. 

A big selling point of AirBnB is the social aspect -- talking to, and learning from the people you are living with. Yes, there are a lot of ""whole place"" rentals where there is no interaction, but that isn't the spirit of AirBnB. Heck, the founders almost disallowed it initially because the concept was so foreign to AirBnB's spirit because the whole point was for the host to be there for the guest. So, yes, forbidding the interaction with other people living with you is VERY WEIRD and against the spirit of what AirBnB intends a guest experience to be. 

Furthermore, it is even worse that the host is requesting the limited social interaction as a means to avoid exposure of a lie rather than respecting their roommate's wishes. If a roommate wanted to be antisocial, asking a guest to respect that is totally OK. If the roommate actually likes randomly chatting with people, asking a guest to tip toe around that and avoid interaction is just setting them up for social anxiety. 

It is an anxiety producing situation, and it just isn't right to put a guest in that sort of awkwardness. "

Demonstrably, the parity of private vs public funding for these discriminatory housing projects rests at about an 85:15 ratio, being generous to the 15% which is the government's involvement.

Sure, a B3 is worth $3K in good condition, but these are always home-model L-111s or similar. Or over the last 18 months, pretty much any sort of turntable gets priced at $50-100, even if it's crap, missing the tonearm, or completely broken.

"Just like becoming fluent in any new language, you must use it every day. And I don't mean have it on your second computer... I'm talking full immersion: wipe your windows or Mac OS completely off (or dual boot to make it harder to access, but still available if you absolutely had to run something there) and get it all working the way you want. 

Once you truly live Linux for a while, the underlying language becomes more intuitive and meaningful. You stop thinking about commands and syntax and just start operating fluently. And then at some point you do something often enough, and you want to automate it... Sure you can just slap together a script, but then you start to want to make your code look nice - now you're not just fluent in the language, you're creating art (and that's when you realize just how nerdy you really are...)

Now after 8+ years I feel trapped when I'm in the gui... It just takes time and a real commitment to making it just a part of your daily routine. Sure you can ask for a project to get linked up with, and people know of many good projects that need help... but honestly if it isn't something that you find deeply interesting you won't stick with it when it gets frustrating in the difficult points. It has to be something that you really want yourself and are passionate about. That is what will drive you to spend all of the necessary hours to see it through. 

Now you just have to decide if you want to swallow the red pill or the blue pill and see how far the rabbit hole goes...."

"&gt; I wonder if we will ever get to a medium of exchange with actual value or utility. Value itself is an odd concept beyond utility.

Using something like that leads to unwanted side effects. A change in demand for the utility functions would influence the value of the currency, with potential to royally fuck up the resource allocation efficiency of the markets. Also, if currency doesn't represent value, but is required to actually have this value, then it becomes very expensive to produce. Binds up resources we could better invest somewhere profitable. Dead capital, can't work and can't create values, because people abuse it to barter with, people hoard it, etc."

"Yep, but you'll want to get the signal from the com feed line itself (the three-pin XLR in/out on your ClearCom pack), not the four-pin headset connector.

You'll need a direct box to serve as a voltage buffer/isolator between your console and the com line, and a specially wired adapter cable that connects pin 3 - the pin that carries the unbalanced audio signal on ClearCom systems - of a female XLR connector to the tip of a 1/4"" TS plug. Connect the XLR side of this adapter to the com line (presumably through the loop-through out on your belt pack, so you can still have headset capability to talk back if needed), and the 1/4"" side to the direct box. DI to a spare board channel and you should be in business."

His two should be changed to something else and give him healing as well (or give healing on his one based on minions/gods  hit 20 per minons or 50 per 75 per god, maybe increase with level), then keep the ult, buff its base damage, then call him a warrior and hes good I think. His ult is great for team fights and I think that if you made it so that he could follow up on it with the rest of his kit it would be great. "

"Flash cards have always worked well for me. You get to re-write them which helps it to stick in your head a little more, and then by repetitively practicing them, it doesn't take long to memorize everything. Something that helps me a lot is changing the words of a song/nursery rhyme with the things I need to study - formulas , vocabulary, etc. Then you memorize it, and when you're taking a test, you can just sing through the song in your head until you get to the part you need to know for the answer. That's been the best way for me because I'm a procrastinator and often hold off or forgot studying, and I love music. So even if you're doing it last minute, if you sing it over and over, you can get by pretty well by doing that. (Not that I recommend waiting until then lol). There have been many times where I didn't realize the test was today and found myself going over notes/study guides literally five-ten minutes before the test and making up a song for what I need to know. And I've never gotten anything lower than a B by doing that. Actually, when it's that last minute I usually just put the words to beats so they don't have to rhyme, and I can just tap it out and remember during the test. But I'm a drummer so if you're not, that might not work for you haha. :P "

I don't know if I can agree with Cross' argument without some data to back it up. It was definitely interesting and well presented and I'd love to read a research paper on the topic if that's what she's working on. I'm certainly open to the idea that her argument is right.

That said, the differences between Cross' and Sarkeesian's talks were striking.

Sarkeesian stood behind what was basically a block of wood (very Ikea) with a laptop perched on top, and read from the laptop. She did not appear to be a strong public speaker. The bulk of her speech was defending herself from criticism. I'd much rather hear her make her own argument rather than letting her critics control her speech.

Contrast that with Cross who was an *excellent* public speaker. She used the stage and was articulate and she had something of her own to say rather than devoting her time to what other people have said. It was impressive."

I fail to see the problem in rewarding engame players that are competing against other endgame players, as well as offering legit competition to lower and mid players as well to compete against players at their similar progression level. 

low and mid races benefit players working their way up to various GB10 and DB10 comps, and would offer a way for them to get some runes that are probably better than what they're currently using. Also, the low and mid players don't have maxed buildings and huge rune selections (unless they break the bank buying rune packs), so I fail to see where the issue is in that. "

"Great table! But I was wondering if it would be possible to make it more useful. I mean, when I start gambling I need to make a decision on which item slot to gamble. Let's say I'm a wd with every slot holding yellow gear.

If I gamble for boots, I will only hope for one of the set boots. But if I gamble for helms, I will be happy to get any of the set helms or most of the voodoo masks. But since helms and masks are in different category, it's hard to calculate my blood shard costs or chances.

So it would be huge if I had a tool where I can specify that I want item X, Y or Z and the tool would tell me the average blood shard cost."

"Congratulations on the new purchase! I used an earlier model, the D5000, to shoot a billion pictures. It's a fun camera.

Don't intentionally destroy the thing, but don't feel like you have to keep it in bubble wrap all the time, either. Mine spent most of its time riding around in a day pack with very little padding. 

And as others have said- learn to shoot in manual mode. One of the best things that I ever did for my pictures was to swap out the 18-55 kit lens with an old manual 50mm. They are dirt cheap. It forced me to learn what I was seeing. I wouldn't start there, though. the kit lens will serve you well.

If you're planning to stay with DX cameras, you'll eventually want some other lenses. This is a great low-cost general lens: http://www.nikonusa.com/en/Nikon-Products/Product/Camera-Lenses/AF-S-DX-NIKKOR-35mm-f%252F1.8G.html

And take lots of pictures!"

"The vast majority of value that people transferred into Bitcoin is long-term speculation that its utility is enormous, and that economy based on it will grow. However, the bitcoin network currently faces a problem: the network produces one block every 10 minutes, and the block is hard-limited to never exceed 1MB. That translates to about ~3.5 transactions per second, which does not bode well for scaling (even with some innovations currently being hammered out, such as the Lightning Network). 

The developers who contribute to the bitcoin project are divided: One side, the more well-known among which are /u/gavinandresen, /u/jgarzik and /u/mike_hearn, propose some form of stepping up (either automatic and scheduled like halvings, or miner-voted) over time. Another group of devs, the more well-known among them being /u/nullc, /u/luke-jr and /u/pwuille (he proposed a _very, very_ conservative alternative) are against such a change, stating that it will result in high bandwidth use and loss of decentralization. Lots of discussion were had about how bad/not-so-bad the impact actually was, and how to weigh it against the danger of stunting growth and/or centralizing _somewhere else_, but no agreement was reached.

Many actors in the space (exchanges, payment processors, big pool operators) have stated, in a scattershot way over time, that they support _some form_ of maxblocksize increase; however, due to opposition from the latter group, no such increase has been merged into the Core code, for a long time.

In his frustration, Mike Hearn proposed (and later did) to include code for lifting the blocksize in his alternative client based on Core, Bitcoin-XT. It is still being tested, and is supposed to only go into effect if a supermajority of miner adopts it. 

The small-blockers are furious that Mike went around them, and drama ensued - just search ""blocksize"" in this sub to get a glimpse."

"I never denied it existed. I doubt it will ever go away, as it has already existed. People are eager to say ""that's racist"" as a knee jerk reaction, even when it isn't. People like Jesse Jackson who has manufactured outrage in the past by lying about events. 

The people who mention it aren't at fault, but something is off when they see otherwise innocuous things as racist. I grew up around racism every day as a kid. I'm not trying to ""exist outside"" of it, ignoring problems.

"What does box office have to do with how good a film is?  Is *Avatar* the best film ever by a country mile?  Of course not.  People hear the buzz, watch the film, feel disappointed - but by then the damage is done and you've spent your money.  Want a box office metric that actually measures how good a film was?  Ask people on the way out of the film whether it was worth the money.  Critics, too, generally don't understand action films; I've yet to find a critic who I consistently feel understands the genre.  In my experience they have this barely-concealed contempt for the genre and just think of it as what stupid people watch.

My main complaint about *Face/Off* is that it's the juncture where Woo just seemed to abandon the overamped seriousness of pretty much all his previous films, and simultaneously the film where he started moving away from plots based on characters with a deep relationship to each other.  His HK films, *Hard Target* and *Broken Arrow* have absurd action, but the basic premise of all of them is sound and credible, and the overdone action is very much a sort of amplification of the characters' feelings; it worked because as unrealistic as it was, the situation in which it was happening remained credible.  *Face/Off* was just straight up absurd from a basic plot level and so the overamped Woo-ness of things didn't work.  

With regard to the characters relationships with each other, there aren't actually that many interactions between Cage and Travolta.  All Woo's HK productions focus on firm friends or long-standing bitter enemies, or both, and often how the lines between these blur.  *Face/Off* has the long-standing bitter enemies, but lacks the interplay between them, and the way they blur the lines happens in isolation, not in comparison to each other; it's an evolutionary dead-end for Woo's narrative.

Plus, anything that has Nicholas Cage in it fails automatically, and John Travolta is clearly, obviously a bad guy, so making him a good guy doesn't work for a moment; he's a good actor in a limited, specialised range, and he's outside that here.

I was counting *Once A Thief* as being on his HK side of things.  It's a great film - fun, lighthearted, with an intact sense of the deep connection between people and what happens when that's damaged, plus a couple of lead actors who don't suck; miles better than *Face/Off*.

Mind you, I have to admit to not watching Face/Off in ages and I feel like I ought to rewatch it now. Added to the pile..."

"Definitely right there, humiliating Peter would be tough, but not impossible. He's humiliated several times in the show, such as in the episode Running Mates while debating Lois. Difficult even for Doom, but accomplishable nonetheless.

With regards to Death, he's been incapacitated and even killed before. In his first appearance he sprained his ankle while chasing Peter and was unable to kill anyone, instead having Peter do it for him. Later in the series, he died in a car accident and was taken by Superdeath (who so far has only taken regular Death, not humans like Doom). Again, difficult to evade, but not an impossible opponent for Doom"

"First of all, white lies like this to someone at the beginning of the relationship are so common, they even made a Portlandia skit about it.

Secondly, I get the anxiety of not having any past relationship or sexual experience, and wanting to exaggerate things to seem more appealing; it's so easy to let those self-conscious feelings drive you to act as someone or something other than yourself. And it's not a horrible thing; it's such an inconsequential lie, it literally doesn't even matter. But the important thing is to recognize that impulse, and realize that no part of who you are, in that respect, is going to make you any less appealing to anyone that will or could eventually matter to you. I'm 21, but I'm currently in my first, actual long term relationship, which is something I was really self-conscious about until I met my boyfriend. But he never once judged me, and it has never mattered, because he respects me for who I am, and anyone worth your time will do the same to you.

If you're still worried, be honest with this guy, and he is at all a decent person, he will understand your feelings.

"This is a long story so I'll try to make it as simple as possible.  I'm no expert on the solar industry but since I'm a shareholder of multiple solar companies I do hear a lot of in and outs of the solar. I'll add a tl;dr int he end

&gt; Isn't strategic farsightedness one of the qualities the Chinese possess in spades? Are we so wrong about this?

This is the one questions I do not need answering and don't want to bother answering.  I suggest you open a new topic to discuss with /r/China on this issue.

So.  The background. China's wage has been steadily increasing.  Production is getting expensive and many companies are moving their facilities to nearby countries such as Vietnam, Cambodia and such.  However, for some industries, such as coal and rare earth production, they are still cheap because you don't need to invest in complying with all the safety and EP regulations.

The argument was that China was effectively subsidizing panel production by selling panels below what they actually cost to make. ie. they were being sold at a loss.

Which is pinpoint accurate, but you can see their idea on ""how to win a trade war"" is ""SELL CHEAP!"".  Take for example China's best solar panels, the ones made from Hanergy TFP.  Their are selling 3.5 generation solar panels with GaAs technology and boast a production efficiency of 16%-28.8% which is pretty damn high compared to the 15% of Generation 2 panels.

However, this is only great in the eyes of an outsider in solar tech.  Current theoretical efficiency of solar panels with GaAs tech can go as high up to 64%, and the Germans are selling solar panels who they boast has an efficiency of 35%---25% more powerful than China's.

China is subsidizing the solar industry not to allow research companies and labs to produce better quality panels, but so they can sell stuff CHEAP.  Quantity &gt; Quality.  Who cares if German solar panels are more efficient?  It takes 4 years for the solar panel  to break-even (the amount of time it takes to recoup your investment through direct savings in utility costs with the panel).  What's the difference of adding another year to that?

Anyways, back to the topic. We're producing our solar panels in China because it's costly to cope with the EP regulations. The PV cell manufacturing process includes a number of hazardous materials, most of which are used to clean and purify the semiconductor surface.  For example, hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, hydrogen fluoride, 1,1,1-trichloroethane, acetone and the most noterious, silicon dioxide.

You see, silicon is found only in the deeper part of earth within quartz, extracted by the miners in bad conditions.  The moment you decide to go in and find some silicon you are at risk of silicosis. (Get it? silicosis, from silicon mining)

The process of mining also pose a couple hazard to the surrounding environment.  Without careful planning and surveying, you will mine into a underground vein. [This kind of shit happens if it is a water vein](https://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/3gtun9/disaster_after_disaster_subway_construction_site/?ref=search_posts).  And if you mine into a sulfur vein, sulfur is released into air.  Same for other hazardous chemicals found underground---you will release whatever the fuck you come across into the air, land and water if you are careless and did not plan for it, one thing you would not expect from Chinese miners.

Once you extracted the ore, you have to process it.  And that involves smelting that shit.  Doing so will release a megafuckton of...you guessed it, carbon dioxide and because Chinese blast furnace is not the most air tight, we will have carbon monoxide to go with it.  Sometimes, sulfur dioxide is added in as a bonus because they're using peat instead of coal.

All these XX-dioxide and XX-monoxide are just fun and giggles when it comes to the next step: creating polysilicon. You take some hydrochloric acid and some silicon, and bang them together to create polysilicon with a side dish of silicon tetrachloride, on a 1:4 ratio.

Ooooh baby, silicon tetrachloride is so awesome, it will keep those farmer nongs off your ground forever and ever because silicon tetrachloride is outright poison to all forms of plant, does not break down easily and produce more Hydrofluoric acid and Hydrochloric acid to seep into underground water veins, to poison more water sources in other towns and city and kill *their* plants and animals, plus all their fish.  That is of course, only if you dump them straight into the ground, which is the Chinese way to go.

Now, once you have killed all the plants and children nearby, it's time to move on to the boring part: plating.  You need to use some science to make the polysilicon stick onto...stuff, so the electricity generated can be transmitted.  Most of them time, we make it stick onto PCBs, in which involves more Hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, tarnishes, etchers, cyanide, trivalent chromium, hexavalent chromium, HAP and VOC.

And again, with proper after treatment none of these toxic will be released, but it is simply not the Chinese way to not dump them in neighboring soils.

tl;dr: Environment protection is expensive. China's lose regulation and enforcement lets you release all the toxic from manufacturing solar panels and related industries into the enviroment."

"Doh, looks like I'm getting hung up on English again.

*Miscarriage* in English absolutely unambiguously requires death of the foetus; otherwise is it just premature birth. 

*Further harm* would have necessitated there being harm in the first place (which I had assumed to be the miscarriage, rather than just a premature birth). 

*Departing fruit* again I had assumed to be a way of describing something other than regular birth.

But, yes you're right: the interlinear thing doesn't talk of *further* harm, just harm. If 'departing fruit' is used elsewhere to mean regular live birth I wouldn't have a leg to stand on here. 

So if indeed this is the case, and it is just speaking of premature birth and not at all of miscarriage then I fully concede this point, and would need to completely revise my position about the biblical view of abortion.

"here's my suggestion:

cynthia, juno, ravian

skorn, valkia, shu

khirel, elliot or rosaria, mikael

So your team is still very young and has a long way to go. I recommend putting Juno up with Ravian to give your frontline a reflex boost, to help Ravian get that ball back immediately and shoot again. Same reason for putting Cynthia up front -- she's your best stealer.

I think putting Valkia mid with Shu is good, cuz she reduces enemy action bar + spirit, and Shu recovers your line's action bar + HP. Ideally you'd want a stealer totem to fill out your mid, but all you got is Skorn. Someone like Eden is perfect -- even if she's a 4star, some people use her for a very very long time. (I'm still keeping my Eden around)

Mikael and Khirel really belong in the back, because Mikael gives HP to your GK, and they're also your two strongest attackers -- they can drive up the ball to your front very easily.

Right now, you'll want to focus on getting good front-line totems for Ravian. The most popular Ravian combinations today are Jeunese, Milky Way, Jury, White Guardenia, Black Daisy, and Alkyde. Ravian + Jeunese is actually insane, and it's the combo that I fear the most.

After that, you'll want to find a good totem for your mid and backline. Kiki, Nerua and Yuri are the top totems right now (you've already got Mikael)."

"im curious on this mind set, most EK i talk to, and a couple of other classes have very little interest in chrons, just because they would rather deck themselves in legendaries and epics.

I think people are kinda only so into chrons because its sorta this mind set where tehy thing they will be best of the best if they get their chrons done, when really alot of the end game shit pug raids are looking for is a chronset + Epics because of how they interact with one another. My summoner has a 9 set, and my chaos a half double imbue set, and my creator deck in legendaries clears all content easier and faster.

"Most martial arts are pretty useless in MMA. Anything seriously designed to defeat/maim/damage an opponent is banned in MMA, but is usually core to a LOT of martial arts.

Chin Na (not a style in itself, but often part of plenty of kung fu styles) is banned because of it's small joint manipulation. As are the gouges, strikes to the back of the head etc. All banned (and rightly so in a sport). But there are kung fu stylists that do reasonably well in MMA, but they end up looking very similar to BJJ + punches and kicks, because that's what's most effective on a soft mat, inside a ring, with rules.

On the street, where there's concrete instead of a mat, you don't want to go to ground nearly as readily. Where you can snap a person's fingers as they're trying to choke you, all those extra techniques are really damn useful.

No single style is better than all others, there's a whole bunch of factors, such as picking a style suited to your body type (stock people aren't going to do as well in TKD as they would in something like Shotokan), who teaches you (do you only do form/kata work with light sparring, or do you go full contact?), have you ever BEEN in a real fight? All these things come into play. But the most consistent indicator of who is the better person in the fight is, how experienced at actual violence the person is and how willing to hurt another person they are. "

"Empathy makes it hard to not care. But for those of us without empathy all the time it's a valid perspective. 

People forget empathy gives you a personal involvement in the suffering of others. Imagine if you didn't have to feel anything when other people suffered. It'd be as meaningless as anything else. 

For some reason it seems like people with empathy can't imagine not having empathy, so they typically judge people. "

"[Round 1](#s ""This is French or Flemish or something. Either way, probably Belgium. Okay, the word Huy keeps going on this road, it's probably important. Indeed, found Huy on the map.

"To answer question 1- Ancient Origins and Roaring Skies are separate sets, so there are no cards that are exactly the same in both sets. There are duplicate pokemon though, for instance, there is an Inkay card in AO as well as RS.. But the cards have different art and different moves. If you look at the little symbol in the bottom left hand corner of the card, each set has it's own symbol.

I suppose you could say TCG sets are a limited time thing in a way, as eventually they stop printing sets as more new ones are released. But each set is available for way longer than a month. It's more about how often each store stocks each set of cards. For instance, the Walmart where I live tends to have the two most recent sets in stock almost always, so right now they have plenty of AO and RS, but not much else for single booster packs. They do still stock Phantom Forces, Furious fists, etc as well as some of the Black and White sets, but not as frequently as the most recent sets. On the other hand, the Target near me tends to stock a better variety of different sets. But you can always find booster packs from different sets online.


Bulbapedia has lists of all the cards in all the TCG sets, here's [Ancient Origins](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Ancient_Origins_%28TCG%29) and [Roaring Skies](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Roaring_Skies_%28TCG%29). And here's a list of [all of the TCG expansion sets to date!](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon_Trading_Card_Game_expansions)

"If you can get Scream dead, then even if Agent Venom dies you're still 100% golden. In fact it might even be a little easier, because once Carnage has lost his ability to get follow-up attacks he loses a lot of his attack and his super healing. I found Anti-Venom heals for pretty much all the damage Carnage can dish out (even with a 4 attack) if he doesn't have the scrapper bonus any longer, and he can't bleed. (My Anti-Venom has all Health/Acc/Atk and he out heals the damage). That leaves you getting stacks of enrage while you take your time killing Goblin, and then finish up taking out Carnage."

"&gt; Additionally, there was such balls of steel by Belichick to not call a timeout. If the NE faithful are honest enough to recall, I bet almost every single Patriot fan was screaming, ""Timeout!"", at the TV after the Lynch was stopped to bring up this most famous 2nd down in Super Bowl history.

I'll be honest, and nope I wasn't.  I assumed BB would call that time out and was already calculating how much time Brady would have to get in FG range after the inevitable Seahawks TD, but after 5 or 10 seconds ticked off I realized he was playing a different, much ballsier clock game than I'd expected and trusting his D.

"This makes sense. Spoilers from the Civil War comic ahead.

[Initially Cap and Spider-Man face off in a back alley as the Superhero Reg Act is introduced. Spider-Man and Cap do not fight to hurt each other more so than just an altercation between two skilled fighters. As the story unfolds and Spider-Man switches alliances to Cap's side, the Cap team rescue Spidey after a particularly bad encounter with a super team of bad guys working for the Gov't. Spider-Man then sheds his Iron Spider suit and goes back to his traditional Blue and Red. Expect some form of this story to play out in the film, with Spidey initially siding with Stark and then swapping to Cap's side by the end.](/spoiler)

The driver was in a coma for a while, the kid in the passengers seat decapitated, the kid in the back had his head and spine ripped out, or at least that's what the rumors were.

You also have things like Liquid Crystals, Soft Matter (flesh, polymers, etc. as you cannot really define one as either or). 

Directly from lecture notes: ""Identical in state of order to liquid (short range, no long range order) but behave mechanically as a solid. They are liquids but with a relaxation time that is effectively infinite and therefore behave as solids over all normal observation times and in response to forces of finite duration"" - Dr Susan Perkin."

The media didn't make the memes about this guy, the internet did. Ask the internet why he was more hilarious. I think it's obvious why: he was irate, uninformed, and incredibly rude, and his rant has staying power because a lot of people probably watched that and thought ""that's the base, right there"".

Pterosaurs are not dinosaurs, but where their closest relatives, together forming the clade *Ornithodira* with their (back then) ground-dwelling kin. The oldest pterosaurs lived about 230 million years ago, dinosaurs emerged a bit earlier.

Together with a few more obscure groups *Ornithodira* also form *Avemetatarsalia* or *Pan-Aves*, which includes all animals closer to birds than to crocodiles.

Bird, on the other hand, evolved in the Jurassic period from small feathered theropods (we nowadays have a pretty good read that ""flight feathers"" originally eveolved to show off, not to fly), co-existing with Pterosaurs until the K-Pg extinction event wiped them off the map. In fact, bird already had heavily radiated out during the Mesozoic, with *Neornithes* (or simply *Aves*), the early forms of our modern birds, as just one of many groups. The meteor wiped them as well of the map - as well as most proper brids as well. A study that came out December last year suggested that all modern birds go back to 4 small groups of species right after the mass extinction.

Also note that Pterosaurs weren't scaly at all, they were covered in fur-like filaments called *pyctofibres* which may or may not have a common origin with bird feathers-"

"Not a former gymnast, but I do think gymnastics has lots of aspects that will carry over to other sports if she decides to change things up later on. Just off the top of my head - if Crossfit Kids is something you're on board with, she'd probably have a huge leg up there because she has a solid gymnastics foundation. And if she starts to get tall, the flexibility she's built could make her a killer hockey goalie. She could also try fencing - most clubs take kids her age &amp; older in all sizes, and flexibility &amp; balance are huge assets. I might guess that dance or some track &amp; field events would translate as well, but I don't have any firsthand experience with those.

I do think there's a huge mindset difference between people who do well in team sports vs individual sports, so that might be something to keep in mind if she wants to move on later. (And probably sports with &amp; without balls -- I just duck when a ball comes my way =D )"

They think that it's a selling point and evidence of why they deserve that much, when they have no relevant experience to back it up. All that tells me is that you are a professional student. If you are going to not list your MBA because you are afraid it's going to overqualify you for the positions you are trying to actively pursue, why get it at all?

"I've had this discussion countless times on reddit. 

What we call ""supernatural"" is simply a function of our *perspective.* The double slit experiment revealed a ""supernatural"" phenomenon because from our perceptive inside the existing scientific paradigm, the behavior of the photons *appeared* ""supernatural."" We updated our models with various interpretations of this observation, and voila! ""Supernatural"" becomes ""natural."" The same thing goes for other phenomena. For example, if ghosts exist, they are not ""supernatural,"" they are natural, they only *appear* supernatural from where we're standing.

""Supernatural"" is not necessarily synonym for ""fictional,"" (although in some cases things we call supernatural are fictional) it is an abbreviated way of saying ""that which is inconsistent with the current models of reality."""

Until an interview with her husband, Steven Grant.

It was, and he managed to evade police, Fugitive-style for a few days before they caught him.

"1. That isn't really new news though. The Celtics' first, second and third priorities were trading up. They never wanted to make selections at 16, 28, 33, and 45. However, in the case that they couldn't trade up, they probably had a list of realistic targets who would be available at 16. And I'm sure Rozier was atop that list, since guys like Portis and Dekker were projected to go there adn the Celtics passed. This has been the case all along

2. I think it has more to do with *who* the Celtics are trying to trade with. So far they've offered picks to teams like Atlanta, Charlotte, Miami, and Washington. All of those teams are trying to win now. They would obviously value a guy like THJ or Winslow over a pick two years from now. The Celtics want to make trades with teams that are looking to sell, not buy, and when that inevitably come along, they will make a very competitive offer."

But these guys aren't one guy liking a TV show without a bottom rocker or MC patch.

"did you sign up for selective service when you were 18? Or vote in any elections? Because I believe that is where they get the names from for jury duty.

I have always found a way to get out of it because I work nights... and serving jury duty during the daytime would be like anyone else (working normal daytime hours) having to do it at 2am. And I am not about to ask  my boss for nights off so I can serve jury duty during the daytime when I am not normally at work.

Note: I have not voted since 2005

Edit: One time I was sent a jury duty notice (postcard) from a neighboring county that I never lived in. Was that a mistake? Or can they do that?  Can they ask you to serve jury duty in a different county in another part of the state? Like four counties over? We have BIG counties where I live."

"Ugh this episode was so good!! I liked it a lot, and it's really sad that they got a new low in ratings just when they brought back real bells hide and seek. :/ Which is something a lot of fans have wanted to see returned. 

The editing was choppy, again (this has been a trend lately) and the acting at the beginning was super hammy, but the games were hilarious. The guests were also truly funny this episode and meshed wonderfully with the cast (it helped that they literally didn't give two shits about their images). 

I love that we got to see their personalities/the way they think, especially during the sneaking game! It was hilarious just how inept some of them were (also Jae-suk's luck is unreal). Also the Ji-hyo/Jong-kook face-off was the best, it was so funny that they were supposed to be competing but clearly did not get the memo and so acted like a team the entire time, kept shouting for each other and getting caught in photos together while giggling. (And KJK totally got criticized by the others who were watching lmao. Even the production crew took a jab at him in editing... ""we'rejustfriends.jpg"" when they got a little too touchy haha.) [spoiler](#s ""it's doubly funny because they were literally playing for different teams for the entirety of this episode, and they knew it too because they both got hints early, but were super buddy buddy the entire time"") 

[spoiler](#s ""I did wish the cops won in the end!! It was a tight race, and it probably made for better TV to have Gary pull off that narrow victory, but they did an awesome job in such a huge space and I loved some of their tactics--like Jung-min shouting out of nowhere to make Haha run out of his hiding spot. Also the three of them taking down KJK... sort of. I just wish they'd been more strategic or allowed to be more strategic about the car! either checked for their mission, or had someone steal Suk-jin's tactic and hide out inside the car to bust them right at the end. that would have been AWESOME"") "

"I really liked economy in begining of the game. I was desperately trying to do witcher contracts just to have enough money for alcohol to make basic healing potions. Also, more importantly, it forced me to be very greedy - when game gave me an option to not take the money for killing a monster because the victim's family might need it more -- I absolutely took the money, feeling bad in the process. It was great!

Unfortunately, after like 10 hours into the game I quickly made a lot of money simply by selling weapons of fallen human enemies. And then, when my inventory was full of random swords, I only picked up unique or magical weapons. And I never had money problems again. Doing witcher contracts ceased to be a necessity.

For me, it didn't work. The moment I ceased to have money problems, I almost exclusively started doing only plot-relevant quests. I felt bad for ignoring sidequests, because fuck, witcher contracts are SO well made... But the fact that I was rich made me just stop caring about them. The tension was lost. 

Honestly, I think the problem is that selling stuff is just too profitable. If it depended on me, you could only make money from witcher contracts and nothing else. "
"My guess is propaganda or censorship plays a role in such a high approval rating. Doesn't make it right but the blame usually lies in governments and extremists more than the average person. 

I had a disabled Israeli veteran stay in my house on some sort of program. His younger, 19 year old, brother was killed in the conflict last year. He told me most people didn't want war, as well as that if you lived in Israel or Palestine you knew somebody who died in some form of conflict. 

The problem doesn't really stem from the God-given right. It happens because of the push/pull of politics. You want to give as little as possible and they want to take as much as possible. So they say you get none and they say that want all and nothing gets accomplished. "

"That is just another point where you are out playing your opponent. It is still you setting up a situation where you can have one member use a very unsafe move and another person use another unsafe move with it. Since there is no active hit box and both characters are just standing around it is easy to punish. The G&amp;W is trying to catch a slow moving projectile so hitting him will prevent it from being caught, but you get hit by the hit box instead, or you can more easily hit Lucas with something. There is no longer anyone holding the opponent back and this prevents the hit box from coming out and a free punish on Lucas and G&amp;W at that point. The only safe way to get this charged is to get in a position where you won't receive pressure, thus you are in a position where you have already out played your opponent."

"Just graduated from the program in June.

My perspective: If you're interested in the skills, concepts, and themes in geography, GIS, spatial analysis, spatial statistics, cartography, etc... it is worth it. I wouldn't consider it an easy program at all, and based on the fact that about 50% of the students who started with me in 2011 either failed out or are going back for a 5th and likely a 6th year, I don't think anyone should call it easy. Most of my friends who graduated with me this spring has great jobs already and even some of the ones who will finish next year do as well... It seems to have a pretty high employment rate among the students who actually have a brain.


The program has a bit of an easy reputation based on the liberal geography courses that non-Geo students take. Those classes represent nothing of the actual breadth and depth of the core geography classes. So you're on the right track to speak to someone who's taken the actual program.

This is bullshit. This kind of thinking gets people trapped in bad, abusive relationships because they think this is their 'one love' and they'll never get another chance.

In your case, there is a problem and your fiancée is refusing to even try to fix it, so you guys are not a good team and probably not good life partners.

"I changed the last paragraph of my previous post. I think you're using the amp in a way it was not intended by plugging your headphones in. Copied this next bit from a [post](http://www.head-fi.org/t/64079/amp-vs-preamp-vs-receiver-vs-dac):  

Preamp : it's the control unit of a system. Basically, it's a volume control and an inputs/outputs selector. In some case, it also incorporates a phono preamp (the signal coming from a turntable is very weak and need further amplification before being usable; it's also in need of some tonal adjustments). Finally, a preamp can be active or passive : a passive preamp is just a volume control and a few switches, it just attenuates the signal. The signal coming out of it can only be 1 or under. An active preamp puts the volume control between gain stages, in order to present a stronger signal to the amplifier and ease the pressure on the output stage of the dac and input stage of the amplifier. It also cures some impedance mismatches.

Amplifier : it's what gives actually power to your speakers. The weak signal of the DAC isn't sufficient to move the magnets of your speakers (it's in the order of a fraction of a W). The amplifier scales up the signal."

"I understand that not all of these aren't durability feats, but they're pretty absurd.

Thor also drank the a portion of the ocean in one swig and lifted all of Jormungandr except the ends in the same poem. He also manages to walk 9 steps after killing Jormungandr, before succumbing to its poison. Thor was able to kill Thrym and all of his relatives when he was forced to disguise himself as Freya to wed.

Thor's son, Magni, manages to lift the leg of a giant off of Thor at 3 days old, when all of the other gods couldn't get it off of him.

Probably the most notable durability feat was when Odin hung himself from a Yggdrasil and stabbed himself with his spear, for knowledge. He didn't eat or drink anything those nine days.

These are just the ones off of the top of my head. I'm sure there are more, but I can't think of any more right now."

"I think the best think you can do is to start having conversations with experienced, successful businesses owners that you respect and discuss your idea with them to get their input/advice. At the same time, I would sit down and hammer-out a business plan. The business plan (while debated by some as an absolute necessity) will really cause you to think about all the intricate details of your business idea and what you plan to do to successfully execute your plan. From there, if the idea still looks viable and receives positive feedback from the business leaders you spoke with, I think it's important to establish your company's brand identity and get a website up (at least a landing page). Then it's all about successful execution which is the hardest part.

"Sorry to discourage anyone here. But I actually am a biology student specializing in microbiology. I looked into this product and it is not as wondrous as it sounds for multiple reasons.

1. The bacteria it uses is in the *Nitrosomonas* genus. These little buggers are only capable of metabolizing ammonia. While they do have the ability to breakdown urea, a major component of sweat, it is not the only thing that causes mal-odor.

2. In addition to the severely limited metabolism, these guys also divide extremely slowly; it takes 20 hours to divide once with a constant food supply under perfect conditions. Conversely, *E. coli* and many other microbes only take about 20-30 minutes.

3. These guys are extremely vulnerable to soap. Like, absurdly vulnerable to it. Normally when you wash, soap kills enough of the bacteria to prevent a smell for several hours until the survivors repopulate. An entire population of *Nitrosomonas* can be killed just by a little bit of shampoo washing over where they are living.

4. B.O. is mostly caused by other bacteria breaking down other components of sweat, not just urea and ammonia. So even if you could get a sufficient population of *Nitrosomonas* built up to digest all the urea, all the other bacteria would eat all the other junk in your sweat and still cause B.O.

5. Because of all this, you would have to keep buying their stuff and applying it just like you do with regular deodorant already. What you get is a more expensive and less effective option.

It is entirely possible to create a product like they are trying to, just not with the organism they selected. Currently I am even working on it, and while I have some theories, I am not sure what can work just yet.

YOU'RE the one with misinformation! All I had to do was google neonicotinoids gmo corn and I found a page full of results talking about how (1) corn is a major protein source for honey bees and (2) GMO corn is treated with neonicotinoids.

[This website](http://www.panna.org/blog/ge-corn-sick-honey-bees-whats-link) talks about how bees:

 * fly through clothianidin-contaminated planter dust;
 * gather clothianidin-laced corn pollen, which will then be fed to emerging larva;
 * gather water from acutely toxic, pesticide-laced guttation droplets; and/or
 * gather pollen and nectar from nearby fields where forage sources such as dandelions have taken up these persistent chemicals from soil that’s been contaminated year on year since clothianidin’s widespread introduction into corn cultivation in 2003."

"also - I don't have the source for this because I saw it ages ago - but I read an article a while back about the nature of the various systems that make up government, &amp; how they basically run themselves.

we get the impression that the head of state can control everything that happens under them, but a lot of the systems effectively operate autonomously, and it's very hard to change their behaviour, because it's so ingrained - they would have to be fundamentally redesigned from the ground up to effect a different product. it's the nature of the input, the relationships inside the system between the humans involved, the nature of the processes they use, the way the data is manipulated, the effect of media pressure, political pressure, diplomatic pressure etc. etc. that determines what actually comes out the other end &amp; the real-world actions that are taken by that organisation.

so you can say to a president ""why haven't you stopped X from happening, or Y from being such an amoral asshole organisation"" but the fact of the matter is, it's very hard to fix a lot of governmental systems. the problems are systemic, &amp; breaking them up to sort them out is an incredibly complex &amp; expensive process which also provides opportunities for things to go massively wrong while you're doing it.

(or more) of the following:

1. Frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment. Note: Do
not include suicidal or self-mutilating behavior covered in
Criterion 5.
2. A pattern of unstable and intense interpersonal relationships
characterized by alternating between extremes of idealization
and devaluation.
3. Identity disturbance: markedly and persistently unstable self
image or sense of self.
4. Impulsivity in at least two areas that are potentially selfdamaging
(e.g., spending, sex, substance abuse, reckless
driving, binge eating). Note: Do not include suicidal or selfmutilating
behavior covered in Criterion 5.
5. Recurrent suicidal behavior, gestures, or threats, or self mutilating behavior.
6. Affective instability due to a marked reactivity of mood (e.g.,
intense episodic dysphoria, irritability, or anxiety usually lasting a
few hours and only rarely more than a few days).
7. Chronic feelings of emptiness.
8. Inappropriate, intense anger or difficulty controlling anger (e.g.,

I do a lot of cooking at home, so for me more and higher-durability is better. But if you're an occasional cook, I'd recommend the following:

12"" stainless steel frying pan with lid

2 qt stainless steel sauce pan with lid

8"" non-stick frying pan (lid optional, mainly for eggs - this will wear out and need replacing every few years)

"With a lot of trial and error, you could probably do this. I don't think it would work by just packing different size gel caps around one another - they dissolve very fast. You would want to mix the adrafinil into a wax (beeswax?) or cellulose, then put it in a small cap. That would already give a delayed release. You could then add more delay by adding more layers of the wax around the initial capsule.

It might actually work better with straight modafinil in tablet form in the center, or pure adrafinil in a central cap, because that would give you a true delayed release where a long time passes with no absorption, then it all gets absorbed in a short amount of time.

Would be a pretty fiddly job though, and you would probably want to experiment with something else than adrafinil first. You could get some beetroot extract powder or tablets and use those - the betalain pigment will turn your pee red very quickly after they are digested, so you can figure out how long the time delay is for different types of wax or other matrix. Alternatives would be vitamin B12 for yellow pee, or vitamin B3 (niacin) which will make your skin turn red but is harmless ('niacin flush')."

The version of the game I used for these is NTSC-J Shindou, the re-release version in japan that supports rumble. This version also has other differences such as changes in the music, the ability to race your ghost in the form of a dolphin, and some other minor things.

We identify and invest in venture-backed startups developing technologies that will provide “ready-soon innovation” (within 36 months) vital to the IC mission. These technology startups are traditionally outside the reach of the IC; in fact, more than 70 percent of the companies that IQT invests in have never before done business with the government.

&gt;As a strategic investor, our model is unique. Our investments accelerate product development and add mission-critical capabilities with the sole purpose of delivering these cutting-edge technologies to IC end users quickly and efficiently. By focusing on commercial technologies and investing side-by-side with venture firms, we leverage outside funding to help develop sustainable technologies using off-the-shelf products instead of custom-built solutions. **On average, for each dollar that IQT invests in a company, the venture capital community invests more than nine dollars.**

See? I'd say that's a hell of an incentive. Here's a 2006 article about the Highlands Forum process that started it all:

IMO, the real reason ""transformation""-oriented defense analysts are pushing for this shit is that it takes power out of the hands of Congress and the Executive Branch, bypasses a lot of the messy bullshit from ""backward thinking"" generals caught up in CYA politics and idiotic turf wars and places it *directly in the hands of the strategists themselves.* What better way to ensure the operation goes smoothly than to be the one programming the networked swarm of units directly responsible for the action?

You are not excluding your father, you are including your partner.   Do not listen to any yelling or put downs about this.   If you are old enough to get married you're old enough to stand up for your partner.

If your family is so ignorant as to trust your fathers opinion rather than interact with the person that is right infront of them thats also their fault.

And yes, it is obviously about age but since we can't change that you either have to realize you'll NEVER be able to bring your partner around your family and get over wanting to, or you'll eventually have to bring him to an event.    Its been a very long time since you two started dating.    Its about time to choose."
"I feel like in certain fields its beneficial to be in a union, and in others its detrimental. Even in the same field depending on the state you may or may not make the same choice.

However, the local electrical/cable worker unions around here offer awesome apprenticeships and training and seem well worth it. Do your research and ask your co-workers friends/family.

TL;DR unions, your results may vary.

It would be a very interesting character, could give good insight into the issues and influence a plotline in interesting ways.

2. I'll study novels with better prose. Likely Orwell, Marquez, and Nabokov. I'll write so that each word is precise.
3. I'll study novels with better descriptions. I'll have to search amazon for this one. I'll use this info to create mental images that people can easily understand.
4. I'll study books with better dialogue. I'll have to look on amazon again. I'll use this to show more personality in my characters.

I also noticed that some of parts that I wrote in as clues seem like errors because they don't have the proper context to make sense (The lumbering star isn't actually a star, and the cicadas become important when the thing inside the ""star"" controls them). I'll only write in details that make sense in their context, especially if they're foreshadowing something.

"Most of the names listed in this thread are hardly surprising names.  You guys want a *real* surprise candidate?  Someone who no one is talking about now who will explode onto the scene and establish himself as a star in the league this coming season?

Andre Drummond.

Having just turned 22 earlier this month, Drummond is often overlooked as a budding star in the NBA.

Last season, at age 21, Andre Drummond averaged 13.8 points, 13.5 rebounds, and nearly 3 stocks per game.
 
This year, for the first time since high school, Drummond will play for the same coach in consecutive seasons, and the Pistons have made it clear that Drummond is the franchise's centerpiece.  Drummond has always paired his elite athleticism with a massive frame, but late last season he displayed serious improvement in his post skills.
 
Stan Van Gundy is building a 4-out-1-in approach around Drummond like he did with Dwight Howard in Orlando.  This is the perfect scheme for Drummond, who is already a historically great rebounder at age 21.  He has more 20 rebound games before age 22 than anyone else in NBA history, and is already the best offensive rebounder in league.  No other player this millennium has recorded more than 400 offensive boards in a season, and Drummond has done it in two of his three NBA seasons.  He was first and second in total rebound% in the past two seasons respectively, and now he no longer plays next to Greg Monroe, who took many rebounds away from him.
 
It's clear that Drummond provides elite rebounding and rim protection, but I think people underestimate his scoring potential.  No, Drummond does not possess a polished offensive repertoire, but he can easily score 10-15 PPG exclusively on lobs and putbacks (again, he's a *historically* great offensive rebounder.  His ability on the offensive boards is seriously impressive).  However, as he showed late last season, he has a burgeoning post game, and is still gaining more experience.  2015-2016 will be just his age 22 season, and with Detroit's offensive scheme, he'll have the paint to himself this year, where he can bully pretty much anyone in the league.
 
I'm very high on Drummond.  His natural talent has never been in question (his physical gifts are probably top 5 in the league), but he really started to put it together down the stretch last year, and he finally has continuity for the first time in his career.  Over the last two months last year he averaged 16/15, and his situation has improved this season.
 
Free throw shooting is obviously his bugaboo, but he's reportedly been putting in a lot of work this offseason, and the Pistons also just hired the renowned and well-respected Dave Hopla as a shooting coach.
 
If everything broke right for Drummond this season, he could put up Prime Dwight numbers with better rebounding.  Van Gundy has the 11th highest coaching win% of all-time (among coaches who have coached 500+ games), and it's clear that this Pistons squad is built around his vision.  The Pistons could easily be one of the NBA's surprise teams this year, and they will be led by the up-and-coming Andre Drummond.
 
[Here are some of his highlights from last year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEeRQJ0mQfo).  Note how incredibly well he moves for someone of his massive stature.

I think Drummond will be a star in the league, it's just a matter of when."

"'You'=Collective. Nothing personal.

I also thought that it was OK to be fairly open about how you felt, your insecurities etc. once with someone. Not first date obviously but in an established LTR. What I did not realise was the expectation that you'd be a lot more reserved than the media made out, nor that there would be some sort of check list. Nor did I realise that although I must be her shoulder to cry on, she will only view me as a friend if I tried to play it the other way around. 

I knew that everyone shoots for the best when single, but I did not know that women replace men willy-nilly (branch swinging) when the next best catch comes along, in an established LTR. Sometimes with total dismissiveness to the bond you had previously formed.

"Actually, it isn't a case of running fine or not, ethanol won't effect how the engine runs in a noticeable way in pretty much any car unless it has pre-existent issues.

The problem with older cars is that older cars often had rubber fuel lines that can't stand up to ethanol in the fuel for an extended time without being damaged, ethanol will eat away at the lines over a long term. Not too big a deal, just that you'll have to replace them eventually

Older cars with carburetors also often will have some leather and/or plastic parts in the carb that again aren't compatible with ethanol and will just wear prematurely, once they reach that, replacing them with a modern ethanol compatible carb solves that problem.

If the car has metal fuel lines and no carb it will do just fine running on ethanol."

"Actually, handguns are a bit harder to silence than a rifle length barrel in the same caliber. Longer barrels tend to be quieter, as more of the gun powder is spent accelerating the round than just making a loud muzzle flash. As long as the extra time in barrel doesnt lead to the bullet breaking the sound barrier if it wouldnt otherwise, then it should be quieter.

Well, the muzzle blast will always be quieter from a longer barrel(though still very loud for most), it would be the supersonic crack that could be introduced.

Many rifles are made in the same calibers as pistols(22lr, 22mag, 38spl/357mag, 45acp, 45colt, 44mag, etc) so the real issue would be the caliber, not the gun itself. And suppressors can fit any gun with the right thread size at the end of the barrel.

Though, the only reason some of those calibers would be easy to silence is because they are going so slow, and are thus much weaker than they otherwise could be.

Being able to reduce the noise of some of my rifles would be awesome though. Wouldnt annoy the neighbors or other people so much, would be better on the ears(especially if you hunt with a dog, since they rarely wear ear plugs)"

"Insurance companies pay out between 75 to 80% of their revenue on claims. That means there is 20-25% of potential savings. Obviously whatever system replaces it will have the own overhead. If you made the system super simple for doctors, you could get reimburse them at a lower rate than the private insurers. Rates couldn't be at medicaid levels (too low), maybe medicare levels or a bit higher. Doctors in turn would have to fire some administrative staff, presumably because dealing with a single payer would much simpler than the current system.

You might also get medicaid people better access to preventative healthcare and hence save money overall. Currently most practices scorn medicaid because the payments are too low. However this is inefficient overall since those patients will just go to the emergency room and ultimately the hospitals will have to cover that (because again medicaid reimbursements are low) which they will charge to private insurers which then ultimately charge to the employers.

It's a bit of an ""if you build it, they will come"" scenario. But, of the course, the best evidence that it will works is from all the countries with single payer systems."

"&gt; Thanks for the corrections. I haven't been aware of her standing in the Democratic party based on voting record, so much of what I had based the opinion on has been her voiced stances, and in many cases, lack of a voice on issues. 

No problem!

I think it's a matter of the fact that while she has been consistently leftward, she is very much an establishment politician. So she'll have high profile votes (e.g. Iraq War) where she diverges from what the left base wants. But that's true of most liberal politicians -- and most of them probably have more defections to boot -- they just aren't as high profile politicians as she is, and thus don't get as much attention as Clinton does. She's also strongly associated with her more moderate leaning husband -- which is understandable, of course, as they are married and he has had far more political impact than her, just by virtue of having been president.

&gt; That combined with my poor perception of just how far right the US is compared to similarly 'western' countries (do you have stats that show this to not be the case too? Because I sure love learning) [...]

I don't know that I have any stats, per se, but I think a lot of how you assess this is how you perceive the value of the direction politicians wish to move things.

In much of the rest of the west, they already have low cost university education; high taxation rates; truly universal healthcare (and often single payer); more public transportation; etc., etc. And in all those countries, those policies are generally popular -- so leftward and rightward parties will tend to support maintaining them. But the center-left to center-right parties tend to not want to *increase* those measures. Democrats in the US do. So the question is: are you more leftward for wanting to move leftward (but not as far left as someone else currently is), or for wanting to stay where you are (but at a further left point)?

And there are other measures to consider as well: a lot of Europe is seeing the rise of more rightward parties ([UKIP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Independence_Party), [FPÖ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_Party_of_Austria), [French Nation Front](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Front_\(France\)), [Golden Dawn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Dawn_\(political_party\)), [Jobbik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jobbik), and [DPP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danish_People%27s_Party)), and some countries (Denmark, Finland) have seen the governing coalition shift sharply rightward. The EU as a whole has also taken a very consistently conservative view on economics in reaction to the 2008 recession and ongoing economic troubles, by requiring and enforcing significant austerity measures. Anti-immigrant rhetoric is becoming a major issue across the region.

Other countries, like Australia, have kept rightward parties in power and repealed some leftward legislation, such as their carbon tax program. Israel saw the more rightward parties gain strength in their recent elections.

I would be remiss to not mention the places also moving leftward, of course -- Canada's NDP is well poised to win this year's election (though that's not set in stone) and had an upset win in Alberta's local elections earlier. Scotland has seen the SNP all but completely take over ever district for the UK's house of commons, and if the UK stays in the EU, it will almost certainly be in no small part due to SNP's increasing electoral clout.

So, in the end, I'd return to the original question: is the direction a political party wants to go more important, or is the absolute position more important? For my input, I think both matter quite a bit -- as a result, I would consider the US overall more conservative than most of the west, but not to the extent that is popularly believed."

"I think an example of where connectivity added flavor to a MCU movie in a positive way was with Falcon in Ant-Man. If you remove Ant-Man from the MCU for a moment and look at it, the world it establishes is one in which there are known superheroes and larger than life events going on in the background. Falcon is simply one of these heroes, and his appearance doesn't drag anything from TWS or AoU into the movie. You don't have to see TWS to buy that this guy is a flying badass that inhabits this world. Same case with Black Widow in TWS; you buy that she's a double-crossing ex-Soviet spy without needing any info given in Avengers or IM2, because she doesn't bring that baggage with her. Ant-Man works remarkably well as a standalone movie (except for a few notable moments) because of this deft character usage.

One of the complaints people throw at the MCU is that they believe the events occurring lack visible repercussions in other movies (e.g. the lack of SHIELD in AoU). I actually think this to be a smart move on Marvel's part, because it maintains the integrity of the individual property's stories.

&gt;A Marine on the White House detail during the Clinton administration. A testicular cancer survivor. A world record holding powerlifter. A successful pharmacist. A competitive bodybuilder. A transgender woman named Janae Marie. Matt Kroczaleski was all of these things. Recently outed in a YouTube video, Janae was thrust into the spotlight and bombarded with calls from the likes of TMZ, Huffington Post, and Inside Edition. We've known parts of this story for several years, but it was time to have our friend Janae in studio to help us, and our audience, understand what her life has been like since age 5 and what her future holds. Our two-hour conversation may not always be politically correct, but it's always well-intentioned. "

"In terms of how news, information, articles, jokes, and memes flow from domain to domain - Facebook is usually last to the finish line, so the exaggeration is justified :) 
   
Not to start a war over the correct flow of online content, but usually reddit (and 4chan I guess - but I don't spend time on there) are one of the most prominent sources/origins of Internet discussion and related humor. Then about three weeks later Digg or 9gag re-hashes it, followed by Twitter some time later, and eventually some SlowPoke person who only uses FB as a forum in the same way we use reddit, (well I love and use sites like ycombinator - aka ""Hacker News"" and Slashdot, too), spreads the ""news"" or content on Facebook.  
   
I don't use FB for anything other than what it was for when I made my account and kept in touch with friends in 2004-ish, as I went to a big college and met lots of people quickly by having the specific .edu address - now it's all shitty games, open to the masses to plug or post whatever the fuck they want, and people actually have comment threads over the stuff the aforementioned sites do, but I've found them to be extremely watered down, over-aggressive, and everyone takes things personally since your user info and picture are on full display to see. (I know, privacy settings etc., but it's still an awful place for generating a community of people with aligned interests for the sake of discussion. It's chaos, just like Twitter, but especially shittier.) 
   
I know reddit isn't the alpha-dog in chain of online information flow - so I don't care for arguing about that. I am, however, humoured by the people still living under the proverbial rock on the internet who use Facebook as their vessel of information posts and retrieval. Just as I'm sure there are sites that consider Reddit, even back in its infancy, as the last ones to hear of news - but there will always be people claiming this place or that place is better while it's undeniable that FB is hilariously the universal bottom dwellers...unless there's still someone on MySpace? Oh, I even forgot about LiveJournal - but I haven't used it in years so I don't know if it's evolved accordingly by adding the shit that Facebook has now to stay relevant, or is still one of the main online blog platforms with a respectable community.

He could mature into something good, but I don't think we have the time/roster space to really develop him more than we already have, so a good forward prospect is what I would ask for for him.  We have better prospects than him knocking on the door, and he'd be spending the season in CP if he could pass through waivers. "
"You're pretty much can't block a VPN without hurting business' entities operations, because they use it all the way (all kinds of banks and credit organizations, small startups, security firms, you name it), so that's definitely not an option; some providers, especially on mobile networks, cap bandwith for VPN traffic, but I can't remember anyone who'll be stupid enough to ban VPN altogether.

While you CAN ban all of publicly announced TOR transit nodes, you can't ban all of the bridges, and there's a LOT of bridges. While it's technically possible to detect nodes' traffic and simply ground it, you'll have to build smth like China's Great Firewall -- simply put, you have got to control all out-of-the-country links.

Seriously, does he have people running his campaign? he's dismissing Trump for not being Republican enough, when clearly he's not *that* Republican either, compared to the neocons we're all used to.

"Messenger is outclassed by the Pilgrim in every category except for range. Even the base recoil pattern is slightly better on Pilgrim. 

However, if you already have the Messanger - then I agree - there's no reason to grind out the (possibly) 100s of strikes it takes to get HP. Unless the maybe 3-4% advantage matters that much to you.

While Pilgrim is statistically better - it's not enough to justify the days/weeks it could take to grind the Pilgrim. Especially with a month of viability in Levels enabled Crucible.

As far as why you die to Messenger more - I have no doubt that more people have Messenger than Pilgrim. "

"i'm not saying she should get off, but you basically chanting stuff like ""THROW THE BOOK AT HER!"" when other people have already talked to you about how it's only a misdemeanor and how misdemeanors get dropped all the time.  hell, someone again pointed out that even the example that you used of Ray Rice getting a raw deal isn't' true since he got his charges dropped and his case was much worse in the eyes of the law(knocked the fuck out of his gf/fiance and the law absolutely takes into account the ability of the offender to cause harm and him having fifty pounds+ over the person he attacked is much worse than Solo attacking a person a foot taller than her plus again there was fucking video of Rice doing what he did while in Solo's case it's only testimony from the people she fought).  it's just hilarious the double standards i see MRAs apply to situations but then ignore the other ones and you bringing up Ray Rice and comparing it to Solo is a perfect example of that.  

at the end of the day, a misdemeanor is fine for Solo because WHAT SHE DID WAS A MISDEMEANOR and again they get dropped or reduced all the time.  "

"Yeah, turns out i misrecalled the weird number oddities. It's that the mods only affect the channeling bonus damage. I.e. a 120% killing blow, on top of the normal 1.5x channeling multiplier, brings you up to a 2.1x multiplier instead of 1.5x, *not* 2.6x damage like you might think, because it's only increaseing the +50% damage that channeling provides.

Throwing in corrupt charge too will bring you to a 2.6x multiplier, instead of the expected 4.1x.

This is what makes most other mods better than the channeling mods, because the ""120% bonus channeling damage"" translates to an additional 60% damage while channeling, vs a 90% elemental mod resulting in an additional 90% elemental damage when you're not channeling, and 135% elemental damage when you are."

"His behavior is inappropriate and bordering sexual harassment. You need to make it clear that you are uncomfortable with his actions or he will continue to treat you in a comparable way. Next time he texts you something inappropriate, if you do not feel confronting him face-on, then text back something like, ""how would your wife feel about you texting me things like this"" or hint that his words are inappropriate. I do not think that you should avoid confronting him and stopping his behavior (if you are uncomfortable with it) to avoid the possibility of damaging your work relationship. If he cannot maintain a 'working relationship' amicably once you confront him about his behavior, then I say just get rid of him. He is a family friend, and your family owns the business, and you should not be made uncomfortable in your own place of work every day. I do not think you should need to be polite- just make it understandably clear that you find his behavior uncomfortable and let him know he is not in change of you/ he does not have power of control over you. Be assertive. Honestly, if he cannot maintain a professional relationship after being called out then I doubt that your parents would want such an employee working for them. You are there daughter, they will obviously choose to maintain a relationship with you over some creepy family friend. "

"They didn't implement a system to stop abuses of the timer.

The multiplayer timer already exists to curtail those kinds of abuses and/or connection issues, since it doesn't exist in single-player. It really just tells me that they didn't test it enough to realize how easy griefing is, because there is no limit on how many times you can trigger a stop timer, which overrides the turn timer and has no memory of previous stops.

So long as the player in question is willing to cancel out of and re-enter the stop timer, they can stop the game indefinitely, which is obviously not intended, and something that Stainless should have caught in testing.

If griefing is possible, people WILL grief in multiplayer games. Period. Designers are, unfortunately, forced to design with this in mind. "

"Really, there are two stories here.

The first is that it's possible to be arrested on some pretty severe misdemeanors without ever laying a hand on an officer or, in fact, doing anything that actually interferes, because the interfering, obstruction, and resisting laws were written by a retarded four year old. They are much too broad, so police feel confident abusing them at every turn. We are just paying attention here because *these* abuses are caught on tape.

The second is that the police face no real consequences, individually, even if the department as a whole is penalized. When a police officer makes an obviously illegal arrest, he should face charges for it-his normal protections are voided. Those laws probably exist, but we need to *demand* that our elected officials *enforce* them. "

"Yes. They denied everything there wasn't direct evidence of. I even gave examples. 

Not to mention that the US is acting from a different position than Russia. It continues to deny its involvement in Syria, Ukraine, etc.    
It continues to be unapologetic about its aggression in the Middle East, Central East Asia and Northern Africa. The US still hasn't officially admitted that there were no WMDs in Iraq.

The US is always denying everything they are able to deny due to lack of evidence. And even when evidence has been presented they usually keep denying things until it has been made public on a large scale. And even the it persecutes its whistleblowers instead of holding its criminals responsible.

&gt;There is loads of downvoting on both sides, what are you talking about?


Oh really? 

Yet look at my comments or pro-Russian or anti-American ones and then look at the comments of pro-American or anti-Russian comments.

Could you provide an example of what exactly is still being denied by Russia and on what ""scale"" you believe that to be? You know... you talk in very general terms, so it's hard to take it serious.

"I was an elementary school teacher in Japan for several years. I was once asked by a coworker what ""twerking"" was.

The school's internet blocks YouTube and most video sites unless you have special permission/reason to access it, plus most twerking videos are a bit NSFW, so video was out of the question, even if this had been a professional inquiry. I was forced to explain via demonstration.

I described it in broken Japanese as a ""jiggly butt dance"" and then proceeded to give my best approximation of what it might look like. I think I did an okay job, all the while verbally re-iterating that this is usually done in tight pants or a thong in order to emphasize the ""jigglyness"" of the butt. One of my coworkers tried it out, but he was getting it all wrong; his twerking looked more like a weird hula-dance, and I told him so. One of the other teachers was like ""it's more in the hips, right?"" and actually did a decent job. Then a third teacher was like ""what are you guys doing?"" and we then proceeded to re-explain what twerking was and a couple minutes later, me and 4 other teachers in suits were twerking in the teachers' room with varying degrees of success.

Not my proudest moment."

Description of RP Character (min. 100 words): I ran my family ranch ever since my eighteenth birthday, the place had been handed down ever since my old granny came down and settled on this barren land, through some miracle they turned this wasteland into fields full of grass for the animals. When my Pa came of age granny told him it was time that he took over, he soon met up with my mother and together they had three children, my older brother, me, and my younger sister. My brother passed down the opportunity to lead the ranch as he didn't like the idea of all the responsibility so it fell to me. My parents didn't survive long enough to see me take over but within the week I had enough money to go out drinking but when I did, I woke up on the ARK naked, wet, confused and with a massive hangover.

"Why does anyone have an interest in anything? If you support a football team you don't personally share in their victories, that doesn't mean you don't enjoy watching the game. It doesn't mean you don't enjoy it when your team win.

People are often interested in the performance of something they care about. It's not exclusive to movies or anything. It's just a thing that people do. I'm sure you care about one or two similar things yourself. Ironically, you seem to care quite a bit about people caring about this sort of thing - you don't gain or lose anything from it, it doesn't effect you personally, but you still seem to care.

Where/what are you trying to use port 587? No other mailserver on the Internet will accept mail on port 587 without authentication, it's the submission port and it's for submitting mail rather than for delivering it. 

Your ISP is blocking port 25 because almost all mail that originates from ISP dhcp ranges is spam, if there were a trivial way round it they'd need to block that, too.

"OP definitely follow that advice it's really good a few things I'd add

a) A lot of this boils down to learning to act confident, eye contact is a major point to this. It seems like a lot to do but it once you get into it it just gets easier and easier.

b) Let your boss (someone above your direct supervisor if possible) know you want to work towards a promotion, ask for extra responsibilities (training new starters etc.) but make sure it's not just menial tasks. I have found often people just assume that it's obvious they want a promotion but it's usually not.

c) You are being judged on the job you have been employed to do, not the tasks you help other people with. All the little stuff you do to help out others without being asked will only be noticed by your supervisor and the person you are helping. Make sure you are doing the best you can at your job before giving up your time to help others.

d) Go to work events if your boss is there always. Networking and getting your boss to know you will help a lot.

I'm sure you will be fine, the hardest part of learning to take responsibility is figuring out where to start!"

"This is a great response.  I think I'd like to add to it with some personal experience.  I have sexual abuse in my history, although the only real evidence is physical damage, I don't have clear memories and can't confidently identify what, when, who, where.  

For the OP

I can confidently say that I was heavily emotionally abused by a narcissistic parent and his little enabling helper.  

I began struggling with this massively when I removed myself from the family environment, the feelings, the struggle to be normal against depression and the battle against worthlessness etc etc.  If I described in detail it would be really the same as everything you see everyone else on RBN talk about.  Except, at that time, I pinned all this on the sexual abuse I knew had happened but knew little about.  

I've come to realise that whilst whatever happened was horrific and distressing, it's not the main cause of my problems, being RBN is.  

You can have an isolated traumatic event (like rape) and recover from it, you can be *sexually abused* for an extended period of time and not necessarily suffer psychological damage.  You cannot experience a long period of childhood in a reign of abuse and terror and come out unscathed.  

It doesn't make any of those three things less abhorrent, but the way we are traumatised is not necessarily consistent with society's expectations.  

I was fixating on the sexual abuse in my history as a reason for my continuing anxiety problems, in reality it was just a contributor, a sideshow.  

I'm not for a minute suggesting my logic applies to you, I don't know enough about you, but really don't feel you need to seek ""real"" abuse to justify your feelings ... that's the narcissist and abusers narrative, part of minimising your valid feelings.  "
Really? Cool thanks! I got that dusty ol thing laying about somewhere.
"I think it's more about effectiveness than whether somebody is overly dramatic or not.  If somebody is over the top but it's highly effective, than I don't think that people are going to mind the showiness.  Likewise if somebody is extremely dry in their conducting but they somehow elicit an amazing performance than their level of dramaticism doesn't really matter.  

For example, Pierre Monteux was one of the great conductors and was renown for being a very dry conductor.  Bernstein did some pretty ridiculous stuff on the podium, but his charisma was so strong that people ate it up. 

For me, I focus on channeling the music and what I'm trying to say with the music.  Leave it to others to say if it's too showy or not! "
"Just an FYI. Global warming won't simply warm the earth. It also increases weather extremes, meaning it will cause more powerful storms, longer droughts, but also colder temperatures and more rain in some areas.

"I have been vegan 4 years this past week, and I must say I think you fail to see why people are the way they are in the US. To convince them that veganism is a worthwhile choice is one thing, like agreeing that losing weight is a good goal, but incentive and ease are important in such goal-setting, such as deciding that losing weight is a good idea and having a gym nearby that is affordable and healthy food available. In this case to make plant-based dieting take off there need to be more options that people enjoy, genuinely. I love vegan soul-food. Vegan junk food, vegan proteins in the frozen section, and vegan ice creams are helpful in easing those goals for many. The more widely available these options are the better.

Theists of yesterday were troubled because things like natural disasters happened and they didn't know why. They made up a supernatural explanation to satisfy the needs of the time.

Theists of today are troubled because the universe and mankind exist but we don't know why. They make up a supernatural explanation to satisfy their needs of having an answer to these questions that currently do not have an answer.

In both cases an answer is proposed that does not rely on any observable evidence and instead plays into comforting ideas for those who seek them."

this actually gave me a morbid curiosity to see how bad it is... The first one was really good!
"The adults of this family covered up the sexual assaults of a pedophile.  This makes them complicit after the fact.  If the statute of limitations had not run out they would go to prison for the crime. While they were committing these crimes they ran for office and became paid political activists seeking the criminalization of the sexually immoral.  

The pedophile went on to be Executive Director of an organization financing and building the ""kill the gays"" movement in Africa, while indulging in adultery and prostitution.  He and his parents joined the campaign committees of various Republican Presidential hopefuls on the basis of promoting sexual morality, and taking away the rights of gays.

All the while, behind the facade, immorality, felony crimes, cover ups, and the kind of hypocrisy that Paul commanded the church to cast out.  This is beyond falling short of the glory of God."

At a party in 2009 they had some whiskeys and became friends and started dicking around on guitar, writing their first song, a song about going down on your best friend, now lost to the sands of time. Despite a lukewarm reception at Nashville’s Bluebird Cafe, they have been sitting on each other’s faces ever since, showing each other their bruises and generally doing whatever they want when it works out that way.

"Yea, I've only played 2 RL's this season. Once with Greinke on the mound and a late Dodgers HR saved my ass, and today with the Cubs. The Braves have almost zero chance today, but no way I'd take any team at 1.345 odds. Arrieta's a stud and I like the Cubs bats so I see them winning by a decent margin against a Braves team that would probably be better suited in the AAA league. Might be a dumb play because RL's aren't really my forte, but it was too hard for me to pass up."

"Few things to keep in mind when trying to go to sleep and getting up early: 

1. Light keeps you awake. Therefore try to limit or eliminate any form of screen or light 45min before going to bed. This is especially true of the blue-white light of screens. Someone posted below a program called ""flux,"" yes it does work but its better just to not do any looking at screens before bed. 

2. Have a clear mind. This can be difficult, but thinking about things keeps you awake, even if you are tired. Two things I recommend: to get to sleep focus on breathing, don't alter your breathing just focus on it; or take Melatonin, it is about $10 a bottle is very safe and natural and helps get your sleep schedule back in order. Just don't take it every night, and do a little research on it for best use.
3. Waking up early fucking sucks for some of us. To deal with this you have to be resolved. When that fucking alarm goes off you can't be like: ""uggggg, *snooze*, zzzzzzz"" you gotta get your lazy ass up and moving. Trust me, once you commit to the snooze you are lost, or at least it makes it *much* harder. 

Hope this helps OP! and Thanks for the giveaway!"

"&gt;But the wording seems pretty clear that players can choose a specific hero that compliments their playstyle.  

To be frank, I think you might be over-analysing this a bit, which I guess I can't blame you for since there is almost no new information here. 

I think all that they mean by that statement is that, depending on the kinds of tactics you as a player tend to use, Boba Fett may end up being one of your favourite heroes - i.e. You have to approach conflicts slightly differently as Boba compared to say, Han or Vader. I highly doubt there'll be much customization when it comes to the Heroes, even something as minor as picking which one you want to play.

"No problem! I've tripped a few times, on both acid and shrooms, and neither time did I really hallucinate any 'new' colors, although who knows what would happen in larger doses(the most I've done at once is 2 tabs for acid and a cut for shrooms). However when I look at things while I'm tripping, it's not so much the color of an object that is morphed as much as it is the ""texture."" It's like things breathe and have an outer layer that is interactive with its surroundings. Things certainly look different and I perceive things differently in my head, but there's not much hallucinating in the sense that I see things that aren't there(in the sense that things are altered, but whole new objects don't appear out of nowhere. So things look like they're breathing and whatnot but a little elf doesn't appear to talk to me about it). One of the best ways I've heard psychedelics described is that acid is like science fiction, and shrooms are like fantasy. There's definitely hallucinatory elements, but a lot of it is about how different your perception and way of thinking is changed. It can be both mentally enlightening and exhausting."

"This is untrue; Passive cooling utilizes air intake by means of fans. If the ambient temperature in your room is elevated, that warm air being pulled into the console will only get hotter &amp; cool far less efficiently than cooler air would. Simply having the room fan move warmer air away from the console will absolutely help keep the internals cooler. If you have your console laying flat I highly recommend moving the fan to the right side. This will help airflow into as well as push air away from the exhaust at the rear. If you're standing your console up the right side I'm speaking of will be the bottom. If this is the case make certain the console is set on something solid to ensure the intake is able to pull air in efficiently. Last but certainly not least, look at the slit which runs the length of the console on the right side/bottom &amp; clear off any dust that may have begun accumulating there. Best of luck to you. "

Oh, one comment I do have to make about your fic, specifically adding more meat to it: make your chapters bigger. Right now, you have 14 chapters... and 15k~ words. That means there's barely a thousand words per chapter. 

If, like shortskirtsandexplosions, you were running huge fics and keeping each chapter to a single scene, that would work out great (though he updates daily, so that's harder to do! :P). In your case, you have multiple scenes happening per chapter, but they're still very short. You've gotta expand them. 3-4k word chapters is what I expect of a decent fic. I won't beat around the bush, seeing the wordcount and number of chapters initially made me very wary of reading it."

"See, we're teasing out the core of our disagreement. I give respect to ALL individuals, whether I know them or not, until they have given me evidence as to why they do not deserve that respect (and simply owning a nicer car isn't egregious enough to make me not respect someone- it is not for me to judge their motivations for owning that vehicle). They do not have to earn it. This respect extends to their opinions on how they might like their possessions treated and their other ideals, provided it does not infringe on others human rights/it is not hateful/it is not harmful. It is not respecting an object, but respecting the person who that object belongs to and what that object means to them. The way I see it, letting your dog piss all over their object is akin to pissing all over your respect for that person. 

I think you may not have truly known that people don't appreciate this, especially if you let your dog pee on your car. But now that you know that people find it disrespectful and if you don't examine your behavior to see how it can change so that you're not infringing on others (seriously, how hard is it to train your dog to eliminate in a more appropriate spot?), then you are not a good person."

"&gt;Well, you did say what I quoted, that's why I used speech marks.

&gt; Naturally as a conflict continues, bitterness on both sides increases—that's why I've frequently argued that stopping the fighting as soon as possible must be the primary objective, since reconciliation becomes more difficult by the day. 

No issues with that :)


&gt;I'm not sure this has become an actual phenomenon rather than just one or two isolated incidents (naturally inflated by everyone with an interest in inflating it).

I disagree, because it shows a trend that the government does not in fact have a monopoly on force on its territory, and that is a very serious issue, especially with RS' growth in reputation among soldiers. Which brings me to

&gt; The volunteer battalions, and particularly those with worrying ideologies, remain a tiny percentage of Ukraine's forces. 

Their actual numbers don't actually matter, because their existence on their own influences the regular armed forces. A recent Vice dispatch to the frontlines found that ordinary UAF encampments are waving the UPA flag along with the Ukrainian, with soldiers expressing respect to RS to Henry. RS ideology and mindset is spreading slowly but surely, and this will be a big issue for the government and the state itself"

"I was -just- going to post this. It especially upsets me as an autistic person. 

I think what bothers me most about it is that those parents would rather put their children and the children around them at risk for deadly, vicious diseases than have a child with autism. The trials and tribulations I face on a daily basis may be difficult, but they are not impossible. They are certainly not as horrific as the difficulties faced by children who have to suffer through Polio, Measles, and Rubella.

Autism makes me socially awkward, but it also makes me unique. It makes me overly emotional, and even naive, but it also contributes to my immense passion and creativity. I may have needed a few accomodations, but I have a college degree, as do many, many other autistic people. I have a good job. I have amazing friends, and a wonderful SO.

Yet there is an entire movement's worth of people telling me that they would rather see their child dead of a horrific, painful disease than have to live a life like mine.

And to those people, I only have one thing to say: Maybe you should rethink having children."

"Sure, although it may be tough for me to summarize my thoughts in a concise fashion.

I think the easiest way is to break it down in to how we work, where we live, and what we consume.

- How we work: we work too much. Period. If we actually only worked the hours necessary to survive (ie - eat and have shelter), as well as to keep things in a reasonable state of repair and keeping things nice, say, maintaining gardens, we would only need to work a couple hours a day, max. 3 to 4 hours only, easily. And that time could be spread out throughout the day, too. You wouldn't have to ""be at work"" at 8am. You could wake up when you wanted to, spend your morning how you wanted to, and then do things as you saw fit. The only time you'd need to do anything on schedule was if it was a community project (see my next point) where others were relying on you.

- Where we live: Think about how spread out we are throughout the world. On a small scale, we commute anywhere from 30 minutes to 2+ hours to work. On a larger scale, we move throughout our countries long distances, or even to other parts of the world. When we do that, it requires travel from us to go back to where we came from to visit family, or have them come to us. Think about all the car driving and plane flying that results from this, whereas if we just stuck to relatively small communities, that amount of travel wouldn't be necessary. Why do most people move away from home? To either make more money, buy a less expensive home, or both. I appreciate the concept of 'wanderlust', ie - wanting to see the world, but on a general scale I argue that moving away just isn't necessary. We really should be able to live in a localized area and have most of what we need, very easily.

- What we consume: This one is pretty easy. We devour technological goods like candy these days - think about the effect that has! The constant need for more resources, the waste it creates, the toxicity created by chemicals used in the process, the low-wage labourers used (exploited) to produce the products at a low price. It's horrendous (we really don't see the effects to their full extent in the western world). It's not even technological goods though, it's everything. Even buying a shovel or tools of any sort isn't what it used to be - they break down much more quickly than they used to, and of course this is by design. This is intended so we *buy more things*. And consumption isn't limited to just physical goods, either. Think about the food you eat. Should you really be able to go and buy a hamburger for $1 anytime you like? Should you really be able to go to the grocery store and buy mangoes from the Philippines for $2? Maybe once and a while, sure, but the degree to which we consume exotic and resource-intense food is astounding, and we have no concept of how much it takes to produce those things. We need to severely cut our consumption, full stop. Remember in my first point about how we should work fewer hours and tend to things like gardening? Well, imagine you bought a shovel and a hoe that both lasted 40 years that you could use to tend to your garden, from which you were able to pull food for your dinner on a daily basis... imagine what would be cut out of the cycle if we all did that.

Now, the most important thing to ask is *why* do we do this? *Why* do we live this way? The simple answer: the profit motive. Our current economy subsists on the concept of profit - the incentive for an individual or a corporation to continue operating a business is that they will derive slightly more ""utility"" from the transaction than the buyer; they come out a little bit better than before. But think of the consequences of this philosophy. Why do we consume so much? Why do those tools break down so easily? Why do we move around and shift our lives so easily and without hesitation? Why do we work so much? It's all so we can earn a little more, have a little more, than we did before. And it's killing us. Like, on a grand scale, this process will be the death of us (ostensibly).

So, I guess in closing, what I am really saying is this - we need to realize that we have fantastic technology and wonderful capabilities and opportunities, but that doesn't mean we *need* to use them. In fact, we should really only use them sparingly. We should step back and think about things differently.

My last point would simply be that we often ask ourselves why we're not happy in today's world, with all the things we have and how sexy and modern and shiny our lives are. Well, if we simplified things, we would have more time for self-expression and artistic endeavours and relaxation and interacting with one another on a meaningful level and, hell, even doing some mind-altering drugs from time to time and thinking about space and the universe and spirituality and our relationship with nature. I have no doubt that if we did in fact head in that direction, we would be materially better off than we currently are.

"I would like to see Gage Coins or some other feature to guarantee weapon mods of your choice, implemented into the game.  This is coming from someone that already has 2+ of every weapon mod and no longer needs them.  I feel it eases newer players away from the RNG system so they can min-max their weapons without hundreds of hours of grinding.

I don't understand why Overkill felt the need to nerf XP grinding.  The first 5 infamy levels are the only important ones and with the Deathwish difficulty don't take too long to attain, the last 20 are purely cosmetic.  Realistically grinding XP even through ECM rushing shouldn't be frowned upon, especially if 75% is cosmetic rewards.

Additionally I would like the ability to chain heists for increased XP rewards.

Some other system to track kills per weapon like Payday: The Heist and contribute to your XP would also be a fun good way to improve the grind."

Thinking about starting a page on this subject to see if we can get the manufacturers to start standing behind their products. I appreciate your help but I really want innokin to fix this issue. They were one of the only products that I trusted. I think the competition to get to market has made everyone lower their QC. So sad. Is there any other way to reach innokin in the states beside the form on their website? Thanks everyone for all your help.

"The sun streamed through my window, illuminating tiny particles of dust casually drifting towards my immobile body. The sounds of the street were muffled: a door slamming, somebody yelling, the revving of an engine as it peeled out down the road.

The ground was hard. I was cold. My head pounded and my mouth was dry.
	
I felt like shit. 

For a while, I couldn’t move. My limbs still felt heavy, my mind still muddied from the blackout euphoria of the night before. *Was I really here?* 

From the window, a cold gust of air meandered its way towards the floor, taking its time to wrap my body in its icy embrace. Though the chill wouldn’t let go, I was sweating. I had goosebumps, but my face was hot. My head was about to explode.

Fuck it. If I was still here, I wanted more drugs. Now.

I rolled onto my stomach and, for just a moment, rested my face against the hardwood floor. I took a deep breath and placed both palms against the ground, using all my strength to push myself to my knees. 

Finally reaching my feet, I took a brief moment to survey my apartment. It was fucking trashed, as expected. Shards from a broken bottle lay strewn under my table. Chairs were knocked over, there was cereal all over the floor. Fucking cocoa puffs. All my windows were wide open, all of my books had been ripped off the shelf. 

*Why am I here?*

My stomach rumbled, begging for food, protesting with sharp pangs. But I didn’t have money for food. I didn’t have money for anything. Even in this shitty town, with the shitty weather and the shitty people and the shitty houses, I couldn’t manage to save for shit. 

Fuck, I’m such a piece of shit.

Stumbling into my room, I ripped open the bottom drawer of my dresser. I dug desperately through the clothes, checked in all the cracks for any white powder, any dropped pills, anything. But all I found was nothing. I needed a bump of H, a couple of Oxys or even just a fucking Xannie or two. Just something to get away from this place. Just something to ease my pain, make the aching go away. 

But I took everything last night. Ate all the pills, drank all the booze. At first I was just trying to escape for the night, but after I was drunk enough, fucked up enough, I figured fuck it. I might as well escape forever. Who would miss me? What would I miss? Nothing.

Nothing.

I shuffled to my front door, eased it open. I walked down the hallway of my apartment, bare feet thudding on the threadbare carpet. The walls smelled like must and cigarettes. 

Fuck, I wish I had a cig. Anything. 

I carried myself slowly, posture hunched. The two flights of stairs to Alonzo’s apartment were the two longest flights of stairs in my life. My entire body screamed, straining against my efforts. *Go lie down, you dumb fuck!* it screeched. *Why are you even trying to move?*

On the fifth floor, I stared at the numbers on the door, gold paint peeling. 326. I knocked, slow and deliberate. Three times. If Alonzo knew it was me, he would come to the door. He knew I was tied around his little finger. He owned me. He knew I had nothing. He knew. 

After another three knocks and another three minutes, the door opened to a tall man, pale skin and thin lips. His dark eyes were sunken but sharp. His shaggy hair, even darker than his eyes, hung over his forehead. He surveyed me with a smirk, eyes travelling across my body. 

My feet were bare, toes curled. I was cold, pale. My long hair was tangled in a greasy mess, falling over my face. Dark circles marred my eyes. Under my sweatshirt were lines of track marks, bruises and pinpricks travelling up and down my arms. I was broken. 

“Hey, man.” I whispered, hoarse. “You got anything?”

His eyes narrowed, but his smirk widened. “The question is, have you got anything?”
I was silent and he knew. He knew what I had. The only thing I had, the only thing I could give him.

Without another word, he stepped back and I walked past him into his apartment. We walked into his room. I sat down on his floor as he cooked me a shot, prepared the rig. He tied my arm. Bringing the needle to my skin, he gave me bliss. I felt it spreading through my veins, pulsing through my body. My headache subsided and I felt warm. Cozy. Beautiful. 

The world was beautiful.

I laid on his bed and he laid on top of me, pinning me down at the shoulders. Though he was rough, I was calm and still, soaking in every second of my bliss. He took me, took everything I had. I traded everything for this bliss.

Though I had nothing, in that moment, I felt like I had everything.

But when I left his apartment, when the world wasn’t so beautiful and the air felt cold once again, I knew I had lost. 

All I had was nothing.

"Well, I'll list a few major things off the top of my head.

* We have some new frames and new primes of course.
* We have the void trader now. He comes around every couple weeks and offers powerful stuff on rotation. To get the stuff, you have to sell him your prime parts and BPs for a new currency called ducats. Most items are worth 10 ducats, but the prices vary and some go up to 50. He will charge you several hundred ducats and a few hundred grand in credits per item. He sells primed mods, which go to a higher rank than the original, like primed flow and primed point blank. He also sells Wraith and Prisma editions of weapons--just like event weapons, these have some advantage over the original and give their own MR affinity. His wares are on rotation, if you miss something, he will offer it again, but probably not for a long time. He also adds new stuff to the rotation each week.
* Arcanes have been redone. The old arcane helms are still in the game and still tradeable, but there is a new system in place now for more unique arcanes. You get arcanes (not the helms, just an item called an arcane) by completing the Raid (also new). You then craft the arcane into a helm or syandana of your choice. You can also upgrade the newly crafted item with more of the same type of arcane.
* There have been a bunch of quests and stuff.
* Uranus tileset is now the underwater lab tileset. You can transition between archwing and foot travel by jumping in and out of the water. Tyl regor boss fight is also redone (and he drops the newest frame).
* There has been drama about nerfs and buffs like usual.
* New parkour system released this update. Movement has been completely redone.
* I don't know if you were around when Relay's were introduced, but those are a thing now. big hubs where lots of tenno can hang out together. Several key features are in relays too, like the void trader and access to several factions. 
* New PVP system.
* There is now a place where you can summon enemies to test different builds on if you have them scanned in your codex, and if you have progressed enough with one of the factions.

there is probably a lot more I am missing."

"&gt;Sponsors are more important to the site than videos themselves?

Well yes, obviously. Having people watch ads makes money; delivering the content you're actually interested in costs money. To the stream provider, the ad is absolutely the more important of the two, which is also why it plays first.

If the ad doesn't play, they don't get paid, so there's a lot of incentive to make sure the ad plays correctly. On the other hand, what happens if the video doesn't play? You refresh the page, right? And you get served another ad, doubling the revenue the stream provider got from you on that video. That's not to say stream providers make videos not play on purpose, of course, that would be a wonderful way of pissing off all their viewers, but, well... if it happens once in a while, there's not a lot of incentive for them to do anything about it, is there."

"I'm notorious among friends and family for lacking in will power and drive.  I've been like this my whole life and I also have sleep apnea, truth be told I have never linked the two before but perhaps you are onto something there.  I'm the type or person who doesn't cope with fuzzy deadlines or agreements.  ""Yeah I'll get back to you on that"" can mean anything from a few hours to months.  Arranging and meeting friends is also a rather fun experiment for me half the time.  Do I bother to call them at all?  Do I pull out?  Do I half assedly make an attempt to appear and socialise?  Appear like a normal person?  I'm forever confusing people with my schedule, be that sleeping or otherwise because everything is uncertain until something in the universe forces me to follow through.

I also have a job that means I don't get paid unless I use my non-existant willpower and drive.  Aside from one contract I have no deadlines, no office to drag myself into and be present in in orer to be paid.  I have no set wage, no set income, no guaranteed earnings.   This might sound ridiculous, given that I've just said that I'm almost exactly the last person who should rely on this type of work to live.  I just could never see or imagine myself doing anything else, its the only thing that makes me happy... or as happy as working in the arts can make you, I think we're supposed to be tortured and moody, right? 

Anyway, this is what I do:

*  **Make Lists and Schedules for Everything** -  This is important, and I mean for just about everything.  Schedule your day in the morning when you wake up.  If you have to do a task you usually slack off on - like for example cleaning - write a more detailed list breaking down a time period for you to finish each job inside the task.  Also, always give yourself more time than you need.  If you take an hour to get ready? Schedule 90 minutes.  If you're working on school work and think it will take you an hour, schedule 2 hours.  Give yourself freedom with this; you're not trying to pressure yourself, you're trying to give yourself drive and motivation.  If you decide you want to spend 15 minutes washing dishes and you waste those 15 minutes watching some crappy youtube video?  You just feel bad about yourself.  So give yourself 45 minutes to do dishes, you'll more than likely grow bored of what you're procrastinating with and do them in that time.  This isn't about sticking to a schedule, its about giving yourself a guide to stop your lack of willpower and drive.  The two are linked.  Those with very little willpower have very little drive.

* **Find Something That Relaxes you** - You've already found it most likely; I'm just not going to assume anything.  Utilise it as a helpful thing.  For me?  It's murder mystery tv shows and any sort of RPG videogame.    This is what you go to when you feel yourself slipping.  When you can't be bothered.  Be aware of this.  Think to yourself if thees anything else you should be doing.  Check the schedule you've made.  If you haven't done something, why haven't you done it?  Do it.  Okay so just saying do it probably won't work.  So do it while you're watching the show; if its something interactive that you like such as video games, then watch a youtube video about the game so you're still getting what you enjoy.  You'll do what you're supposed to be doing slower but the fact is you're still getting it done.  In fact you might even eventually absorb yourself into the thing you feel you should have been doing in the first place.  Even if you don't, you'll have still have made some progress.

* **Exercise** - You're losing weight, you said.  So chances are you're already doing this.  Teachers, Doctors, Annoying Vegan Separatists aren't wrong.  Exercising really does make you feel better and makes your brain feel better.  It doesn't have to be strenuous.  Hell it doesn't even have to count as exercise.  A brisk 30 minute walk, dancing like an idiot to your ipod for 40 minutes, even running on the spot and doing stretches.  That awakens your mind and gives you motivation and will power.  It makes you feel good too.  You feel good, you sytart feeling good about yourself and all those things that are linked together start seeming like possibilities instead of something other people have. 

Use all of that to find a routine thats right for you.  Routines are important, without them we often feel lost and lose our ability to have drive, motivation, will power etc.    My routine doesn't appear like a routine to most people until I explain it to them.  Why?  Because its not what most people see as being a 'normal healthy routine'.  The thing is, if I did what they recommended I do?  I wouldn't be happy, or organised, or motivated.  It doesn't work for me right now in my life.  As soon as I recognised that, everything became so much clearer and easier to work with and around.  

You obviously want to make the change; you've said right there that you are trying and you have tried things.    I'm not sure if what I have wrote will help you at all, this is just what I do.  Hopefully, theres something there that might inspire you.  "

"A strange one I had at an old job was when I was talking to an old Indian man who was contesting charges on his bill. I was going over the bill with him, trying to explain charges and he kept interrupting me and yelling. I told him that I was going to help him with the charges, but that I wanted to make sure he understood what they were to prevent it from happening in the future.

Nope. He wasn't having it. He kept yelling at me, and personally insulting me. I gave him a couple of warnings that if he kept personally attacking me, I'd have to terminate the call (this was company policy that I was very lenient with since I understand that people say stupid things when they're pissed). 

After being called a mother fucker, a son of a bitch and so on for about 10 minutes without being able to get two words in, he finally snapped more than I've ever had a customer snap. He started yelling in a very thick accent ""*Who is your boss? Tell me who your boss is?! WHO IS YOUR DADDY?! WHO'S YOUR DADDY?!""

I told him that I had warned him enough times and and was ending the call. When I hung up, I just sat at my desk and I was laughing so hard that CSRs around me to put their customer on hold to find out what was going on.

I either do 2 or 3 sets of RPT, depending on the lift and other stuff."

"If you exile somebody, where is that person going to go? In the modern age, we'd face the choice between convincing another nation to accept the exiled people (thus dumping our problem on someone else) or dumping the exiles in canoes in the middle of the ocean (thus risking accusations of inhumane treatment). If you actually want them to do something productive besides ""regretting their mistakes,"" as you mentioned, some prisons have had success with work programs like that one in Colorado that basically administrates a goat farm and sells the milk to an artisan cheese maker. We could also make use of a reasonable compromise and have the prisoners shipped off to Mars to build colonies. It'd be like an intense version of the way Australia got colonized. England got smart and sent their ""exiles"" to prison camps in Australia. In the case of Mars, the prisoners would basically have two options: Work and behave themselves, or die."

we talk more frequently (3-4 times a week), not like we use to but she is still recovering and i need to give her time. i pretty much keep myself busy so i'm not bouncing off the walls on my days off and when she does find time to hang out/talk i keep it cheery to not stress her out as she is already dealing with a lot already.

"back when I was in middle school and high school I got into a few fights. They're over quick, the ""plan"" in your head never goes as you think, and really if you can take the first punch without being knocked out you gain this clarity, kinda like time slowing down just enough to see incoming punches. Never really got in trouble discipline wise, these fights where done in empty hall ways or behind the school. We also never fought hard enough to really hurt ourselves, if it got too crazy someone in the crowd would break it up or someone would say a security guard was coming and we'd all scatter. This was maybe 10-13 years back, not sure what would happen know to a kid who fights, probably expulsion or something even more drastic. "

"&gt;-I understand there are different sects of Buddhism, what are their differences and how would i go about choosing one for myself?

Finding a flavor of Buddhism or (*much* more importantly) a teacher is like falling in love. It's not a rational process. Expose yourself to everything, see what tickles your tickly bits (spiritually speaking).

&gt;-Being born and baptized as a Christian, is there a ""conversion"" process for me to ""officially"" become a Buddhist? (I understand Christianity and Buddhism can both be practiced but I wish to practice solely Buddhism)

Nah. In some traditions there's nice rituals though, like *taking refuge.* (In the Tibetan tradition the Lama would snip of a few hairs and give you a Tibetan name as encouragement.) It's no *sine qua non* in any way shape or form.

&gt;-What is necessary for me to practice Buddhism? What do I need to do besides seek elightenment, follow the Eightfold path, etc.

Honesty! Buddhist teachings are not about Buddhism, they are about *you.* What's keeping you from liberation is you, and most of the practice consists of staring yourself in the face and saying *you fo' realsies, son?* 

&gt;-What role would a teacher play? How often would I need to see him or her? Just any information on teachers of Buddhism would be amazing.

Traditions, and individual teachers, vary in their approach. Generally though, compare it to learning how to drive: you don't know how to drive, your teacher does. She's your main reference while learning and will do her best to keep you from harming yourself or little old ladies walking their dogs.

&gt;-How can I learn Buddhism on my own? I know this journey will require a lot on my part, but I don't exactly trust the internet to teach my Buddhism and I don't know where to look beyond a teacher, which I don't know how often I would be able to see. So are there any websites/books/other sources that would be helpful?

For now: read, watch, look into everything. *Everything.* Be critical, be curious, don't expect results. Don't stay alone, go out. There's sanghas, groups and temples everywhere, but often kinda hidden. Don't worry ahead. I don't see my Lama that often, but I have his phone number.

&gt;-I'm not confident these are all the questions that I should have asked, so if you think there is anything I should know but didn't ask about, I would love to hear it!

Don't expect it to be fun. To paraphrase Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche: if you're meditating and your life doesn't turn into a mess at some point, you're doing it wrong. 

Try to *have* fun, though. Buddhism is interesting and surprising. There's lots of tea, awesome, weird people, moving rituals, gossip about why this or that monk ain't no monk no more, and other entertainments. More importantly, Lord Buddha's dharma is the path to freedom. Actual freedom. 

It is pretty amazing.

He isn't doing it on purpose. However, you gave an ultimatum and now you aren't going to follow through with it. Your words mean very little.

Step back from the relationship a little and have a think.
Think about all your talks and plans. Lots of words were used.
Words are great for lawyers and politicians.

Not so much for relationships. 

Relationships are about actions. So now have a look over your history here and instead of thinking about the words, think about the actions. What did you both actually *do*?

Your ultimate is an example, you gave words and you said if X doesn't happen Y will.
X didn't happen, neither did Y...

So Z has happened instead which is probably the same thing that is always happening. 

Unless you actually *do* Y, then Z will keep happening no matter how much you talk and plan about it.
What you do know that is if Z happens you feel like crap.
You have got to break the cycle. If you say you are going to leave if things don't change, then LEAVE.

Significant pattern mining, the problem of finding itemsets that are
significantly enriched in one class of objects, is statistically challenging,
as the large space of candidate patterns leads to an enormous multiple testing
problem. Recently, the concept of testability was proposed as one approach to
correct for multiple testing in pattern mining while retaining statistical
power. Still, these strategies based on testability do not allow one to
condition the test of significance on the observed covariates, which severely
limits its utility in biomedical applications. Here we propose a strategy and
an efficient algorithm to perform significant pattern mining in the presence
of categorical covariates with K states.

"&gt; But if it was inspired by God then why are not all versions the same?

""Then I began to see that not just the scribal text but the original text itself was a very human book. This stood very much at odds with how I had regarded the text in my late teens as a newly minted ""born-again"" Christian, convinced that the Bible was the inerrant Word of God and that the biblical words themselves had come to us by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit.

As I realized already in graduate school, even if God had inspired the original words, we don't have the original words. So the doctrine of inspiration was in a sense irrelevant to the Bible as we have it, since the words God reputedly inspired had been changed and, in some cases, lost.

Moreover, I came to think that my earlier views of inspiration were not only irrelevant, they were probably wrong. For the only reason (I came to think) for God to inspire the Bible would be so that his people would have his actual words; but if he really wanted people to have his actual words, surely he would have miraculously preserved those words, just as he had miraculously inspired them in the first place.

Given the circumstance that he didn't preserve the words, the conclusion seemed inescapable to me that he hadn't gone to the trouble of inspiring them.""

"I love this show but  I have always thought that the writing on this show was just plain bad. The majority of the time the dialogue  is so unnatural  and so are all the girls actions. I completely  agree that a majority  of the plots are created simply to be there and same thing for a majority  of the characters. They never really serve a purpose other than moving the story along  regardless if it makes sense or not. Characters are introduced and then are dropped off the face of the planet.  It's evident that they were just prolonging  the story and really had no actual  content for the past 2 years..

The time line is truly outrageous.  An insane amount of things happened between their Halloween  special  from season 3 until their Christmas  episode  in season 5. Then they just skip over time for no real reason.


I really enjoy the show because  it's fun but I have always wondered why so many people always praised I Marlene King and company  as geniuses.  Nothing about this show is truly special  other than the intresting  plot and the actresses. Their attempts at being a groundbreaking  show is what truly damaged  this finale. The cinematography  had never been special and whenever they attempted to do anything  fun with their style of filming, it always ended up being a joke. For example, episode  9 of season 6  had a lot of jump cuts  and you know the conversations  were synced with each other and the girls would finish  each other sentences  and it was sorta cool to watch even though it was over used and unessary, it was the first time the show attempted to do something like that.   There other times where they had silly zoom in shots and ""elaborate"" green screen moments, but again nothing special and it always turned into a joke..


 I had low expectations  for the finale and I was still disappointed.  The writers and directors are all to blame. They had a very intresting story to work with but not only were they too wrapped up with ratings but they also were in way over their head.  This story should not take 7 seasons, a possible 8th season and movie to tell.  


I 1000% with you. This show was doomed from the beginning.  The only saving grace is the cast, but they were never used to their full  potential.  The deterioration  of the characters  is something  that really baffles me.  Spencer is supposed to be a genius  and she just never made any sense.


I love to hate this show."

Saying that sports analytics are shit because whoscored rankings in one game do not conform to what you expect them to look like is like saying ""restaurants are shit, after all, my quarter pounder at McDonalds did not turn out like I expected"".

Truth is, sports analytics and statistics are a huge part of modern professional sports. Fenway Sports Group invests in statistics heavily in all three of their professional team, but the level that they are working at are much higher than whoscored rankings. "

"My only breakup story where I was on the receiving end felt so harsh at the time.  I had a long distance boyfriend who I was head over heels for.  I was 17, so was he, and we lived on opposite coasts of the US.  He was going to be about 7 hours south of me for a few days (brother moving for college) and I SOMEHOW convinced my mother to drive me down six hours (his parents were willing to drive about an hour).  My best friend came with, we met up at a museum, and had a really nice (if slightly awkward; we were both nerds who had hardly been on dates) time.  I gave him his first kiss before we parted.  

He ignored me for a month.  This was someone I had talked to nearly every day, online, calling when we had our unlimited nights and weekends minutes (lol remember those?).  He made the excuse that he was really busy with school, with writing, a new part time job, etc.  All true, but he still... didn't talk to me for a month.  I sent him a birthday e-card, and finally, a bit over a month later, he sent me an email.  A really long email.  It was a breakup.  I read it a few times, cried a lot.  I finally got to the point where I felt like he was a huge asshole.  

I think the worst thing was that I felt (and still feel) that he broke up with me because I was overweight; we'd seen photos of each other, but he was quite thin. It was a hugely crushing blow to any amount of self-esteem I had.  But I got over it.  It mostly just took time and distance.   I'm living with my SO of two years now and super happy.  "

Sanctions mean that various countries have agreed not to purchase Iranian products in an attempt to hurt the country economically, hoping to use this as a stick to persuade Iranian leadership to negotiate.

How does Iran singlehandedly violate sanctions? Or do you mean Iran is violating the terms of the deal that, if followed, would result in the P5+1 countries lifting sanctions?"

I have not noticed country drivers to be more able to follow road laws, just less likely to hit someone because there are less people to hit.

Humans have a tendency to remember negative events, not neutral ones. Since dense traffic includes more total traffic participants,  the total number of infractions per trip will be higher and that's what people tend to remember,  not the other 1,000 motorists that sailed past fine."

"&gt; Support for rape exceptions remains very high in comparison to general pro-abortion rights sentiment, despite its inherent contradiction with the ""pro-life"" rhetoric that abortion is murder. 

Perhaps many of those who are anti-abortion have a more nuanced interpretation of the situation than you give them credit for.

For example, I find [the violinist argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Defense_of_Abortion#The_Violinist) pretty convincing:

&gt; You wake up in the morning and find yourself back to back in bed with an unconscious violinist. A famous unconscious violinist. He has been found to have a fatal kidney ailment, and the Society of Music Lovers has canvassed all the available medical records and found that you alone have the right blood type to help. They have therefore kidnapped you, and last night the violinist's circulatory system was plugged into yours, so that your kidneys can be used to extract poisons from his blood as well as your own. [If he is unplugged from you now, he will die; but] in nine months he will have recovered from his ailment, and can safely be unplugged from you.

However, the key difference is that you bear no responsibility for being in this situation. In the case of most pregnancies, the woman chose to have sex. Sex carries the risk of pregnancy.

To make this scenario analogous, you would need to modify it:

You are approached by the Society of Music Lovers and offered $1000 on the understanding that they will check your medical records for compatibility with the violinist, along with 999 other people, If you are the best match then the violinist's circulatory system will be plugged into yours. You accept the money and It turns out that you are the best match.

This shifts the moral question in all cases except where there was no consent."

"I think the fact that you're trying already makes you miles ahead of other people. You are finding out what works and what doesn't. Sure, some people might strike gold with one thing and then become a somebody in the scene, but even without pure luck, hard work pays off. Actually let me rephrase that to hard work WITH confidence pays off.

Don't be a shitty downer and think ""you've done everything you could have"" and then cry yourself off to sleep. A ton of people don't know the difference between true hard work and hard work.

So let me say that you stopping your podcast project because you didn't have confidence was an error to begin with. You should have kept it going and tried to spread the word more to raise awareness that you are doing something like this. How were you going to get into the scene with just 1 week of work?

I remember people remarking ""this guy is trying to stay relevant by posting all these shit videos."" Well, guess what? He is relevant. He's more relevant than those redditors who said that.

I don't know what it takes to get into Esports, but you can't just ""give up"" like that. Just reading your thread, I don't even think you gave it your best shot.

Find out what you're good at and do something with it. Judging from your attempted podcast, you're probably a good speaker. Try to do something with your voice.

Good luck."

"**ARENA**

Dancing Swords is rated a poor card at 32 points according to HearthArena. 

Let's try to break it down. A 3 mana 4/4 is quite good - it eats 2-drops and some premium 3-drops like Spider Tank, which is awesome, and trades up with some of the 4 mana cards like Lost Tallstrider. I do think that the stats on Swords are very good, better than most people give it credit for. 

Now, the problem is obviously its downside. Dancing Swords probably gets about 1-1.5 cards worth of minions or some sort of mana advantage (for example, killing a Raptor and getting a ping for 4 mana. But this is if we assume we play it on curve - otherwise, it will likely get eaten by virtually any 4 or 5-drop and upwards. Now the question is: will Swords' above-curve stats justify giving the opponent the card? 

And, well, the answer is largely no. If Swords is killed by a Boulderfist, it's a 2-for-0.5 for the opponent - and especially in the late-game where card advantage and resources to fill the board are so important, Swords is a huge leverage for the opponent to overwhelm you. So, definitely a bad card here - since if it stays alive, you were probably going to win anyways, and if it doesn't, then you're absolutely dead!

Well, how about on curve? In this case it's not THAT bad, especially if you're playing a more aggressive deck - sometimes, for these decks, they push hard for Tempo and damage that in the end, the opponent dies in the most tragic way possible - with several cards in hand. And yes, Dancing Swords sometimes gives that push on Turn 3 for that. But here's the thing: this is a rare case, where in most cases, the 4/4's tempo is simply not enough to aggress the opponent early, and that the card will matter once the game enters the late stages. 

So yeah, it seems like most of the time the case in which Swords lives the dream or even makes a good impact does not justify the case in which Swords simply loses you the game. I'm actually personally okay with taking Swords over some bad cards, but I'm still of the negative opinion on this one.

**CONSTRUCTED**

Dancing Swords is a very easy card to evaluate: There is only 1 deck that needs a card that draws the opponent's cards, since Swords is independently a shitty card. The deck is Mill, obviously, but the real question is how many decks actually need the Swords? Some Mill decks don't even run Swords, given that they have some better options to draw and that the body doesn't really matter in a deck that doesn't aim to get board presence. 

In my opinion, I think Swords is more like a secondary option - something that if the player thinks that the other options suck, then Swords can be fit into a Mill deck fine. Or if Mill decks get a little bit more aggressive (which doesn't make any sense, but who knows) then Swords will be fit. But otherwise, there are so many better 3 drops than Swords in any other deck. Put Spider Tank or something if you're really that desperate, unless you're playing Mill. And even if you're playing Mill, try to ask if Swords really cuts it compared to other great cards like Doomsayer or board clears or Coldlight, and see how Swords measures up before putting it in your deck."

"Ah-ha! I was wondering if anyone would bring this up. Yes, Joe absolutely, positively should **kiiiiillllllllll** Baron Corbin.
BUT, they have pushed Corbin soooo hard in that no-man's-land mid-car that NXT has.  He's on the precipice of title contention. If Joe comes in and beats Corbin, they are definitely pumping the breaks on him.  From what we've seen so far with Joe, they haven't made a big deal about him since his initial debut.  Then, the Kidd incident didn't do him any favors.  Maybe WWE sees Joe as slightly better Rhyno, and he's gunna job hard to Corbin.

Joe *should* win, I'm just not so sure."

"I kept a secret from my SO for all the near 4 years we've been dating thus far (we're still going strong). I told him just recently and he giggled at me, told me it was no big deal, and said it was the most innocent secret i could have kept from him. The secret I had kept, and actively lied about in relevant conversation was that I masturbated. I would always say 'no, i dont do that' because i always felt kinda ashamed that I did (even though I knew he did that AND watches porn and couldnt care one bit about it yet was ashamed that i did it as well even though I knew he wouldnt care if he had known the whole time). But one day I finally told him id been lying about it this whole time and that I DID do that and now its a funny story we share together &lt;:P 

I think it depends on what that person considers to be secret-worthy. Because if you're like me, something so innocent and not a big deal can be a secret :P I think cheating involves any sort non-platonic physical or emotional relationship. My SO has friends (hes bi so i'm just gonna say friends instead of guy friends or girl friends) but it doesn't bother me because i know they are just friends to him and that hes loyal to me (and same goes for me, he doesn't mind i have friends (i'm also bi) because he knows its just a friendship and nothing more) but if, say, i was going through some rough times and confided in a close friend instead of my SO i would think that's emotional cheating. In an ideal relationship you should always want to confide in your SO first, they are there to emotionally support you after all and to help with any problems you are going through (or an exception being family). I would feel pretty hurt if my SO went to a friend with a problem before he came to me about it, or if he didn't even come to me about it at all, because he and I are very vocal and we communicate pretty well so i would feel kinda cheated because he decided not to confide in me. Also non-platonic physical relationship, obviously, could be anything as small as a kiss or anything else that'd you'd normally do with and SO that you do with someone else :P 

Obviously there can even be exceptions in that (emotionally confiding in someone other than your SO or family). But just as a general idea thats what I think. It might not warrant me breaking up with him but it would hurt me a lot."

"&gt; What do you think their true motivations are?

For the newtab page, I think their motivations are to have a guaranteed space on which they can show the user things, most likely ads, maybe helpful hints and information, in the future. For signed addons, I think their motivation is to create a walled garden that they can control, just as Apple and Google do with their app stores. Their motivations certainly aren't to stop malware though, because as the Mozilla employee admitted above, they are powerless to stop programs from modifying Firefox.

&gt; Also, how much knowledge do you have regarding the current state of malware infections in the wild? I mean real, large scale, non-anecdotal, non-theoretical knowledge?

I get what you're trying to do, and it's not a valid argument. Obviously I have about as much ""large scale, non-anecdotal, non-theoretical"" knowledge as pretty much any other person you could ask, since the only people who would have such knowledge are security researchers. That's not relevant though, because you don't need that knowledge to know what abilities local programs running with sufficient privileges have.

They are similarly powerless to stop any program running locally from modifying Firefox's resources or even the binary itself."

* I love support classes in games, online or off, though few actually do the concept justice.
* I solely do PvE, as I am utterly abysmal at all forms of PvP in any game. I think I might actually emit digital pheromones that subconsciously tell people I'm an easy kill... it is a working theory.
* I have leveled both a Priest and Mystic to 65, though I am currently re-leveling my Mystic as a different race. I am not experienced in Hard Mode dungeons (only AIHM once in which we tried - and failed at - Duras one time) and only started playing last month, but I would like to think I understand more than the average player.

**PRIEST**

A Priest is very reactive. Beyond support via Energy Stars, Triple Nemesis, and Mana Charge, you really can't do much until someone gets hit. Kaia's Shield can block some lighter attacks, or cut down on a big hit, but **in theory** you can't do much until someone actually takes damage or needs a cleanse. You still have to predict/recognize boss attacks and whatnot, but it's a little less critical for you than it is for a Mystic.

This means your skill as support is largely independent from that of your group; a really good Priest can make up for the lack of skill for the rest of the group, at least moreso than a Mystic. I've seen a lot of people say it's easier to heal on a Priest. While I don't agree entirely with this perspective, I can understand it. It is not 'easier to heal' it is just 'easier to cover for the bads'.

**MYSTIC**

Conversely, a Mystic is very predictive. Between your Auras and Warding Totem you have a lot of passive support, which means you have to think ahead a lot more. Don't forget Warding Totem has a damage absorb component, and re-place it as necessary. Know when burn phases will happen so you can apply Contagion (and Thrall of Wrath but that's not very important at 65). You also don't have any theoretical downtime. In the ideal scenario, when no one needs a heal, your debuff(s) are up, and everything is great, you should still be droppping Motes. In my mind, the Mystic is like a doomsday-prepper. You prepare for the worst possible scenario that will likely never happen.

However, because you have to play the prediction game (or make a lot of guesses), the skill of each player in your group accounts for a lot more. You have to trust DPS classes to dodge a few attacks, or know when to grab a Mote at low health. You have to know who will need a Mote, and have it nearby BEFORE they need it. You have to know boss attacks and patterns a lot better, so that you can dive in and out to heal or support as necessary. You also have to watch your mana more closely, even with Infused Charms. You should not be afraid to consume your own Arun's Tears for MP. Aura of the Tenacious will typically handle everyone else's MP just fine, so those are best for personal use.

**TIPS FOR SUPPORT**

1. Pay attention to when Boons will happen and don't waste big heals/mana restoration/resurrections if one will happen soon unless you really have to. I personally have to get better at this.

2. Obviously carry some Mana Elixirs and Goddess' Blessings, but it is also not a bad idea to bring some Health Potions and even Resurrection Scrolls. Sometimes things go really bad and you end up out of Mana and need to heal yourself while resurrecting the tank when there is no Boon anytime soon. Might as well be prepared!

3. Learn how to ignore Mystic Thralls, Gunner ST, and Warrior Shadow health bars. Usefulness of each aside, sometimes their health can get low and it looks just like a regular player's health bar, until you target it for a heal and cannot. I really want an option to make these invisible except to the owner.

4. Your position is the second-most important thing to consider. The first is your HP. As much as you can, make sure you are in or moving to a position that gives you the best view of the most people.

**TIPS FOR EVERYONE ELSE**

Personally, *I think everyone should play both a Priest and Mystic*, or at least create one temporarily to check out their Glyphs and every skill's max rank at the trainers. The better you know the support classes, the better off you'll be.

/u/bluebirdybird says:
&gt;Knowing how to play a healer well also made us good dps... We knew where to stand, how to behave when we needed help... and most importantly how to take care of ourselves

That seriously made me tear up a little. With that in mind, here are some common-knowledge things amongst the support classes that people either do not know, refuse to accept, or outright do not understand:

1. As ranged DPS, spreading out helps no one. You gain nothing from those back-crit crystals by standing in front of the boss at 20m when everyone else is behind and 0-12m away from the boss.

2. Dodging around needlessly at low health makes you more likely to die. Sacrifice your precious skill rotation, look at the boss, and only move/dodge to avoid attacks for 1 second. A heal should already be on the way.

3. Bring your own health potions, just in case.

4. If you need a heal and are standing near a support, STOP MOVING. We can SEE your health bar. Jumping around or charging back in means you have a deathwish, which we will oblige. Also see above.

5. Arun's Vitae Motes give you a strong over-time heal **and also cleanse you**. Grabbing one is far more convenient than the Mystic targetting you with two different skills to achieve the same effect. ~~When Glyphed at 65 they also restore 20% of your HP so in the worst possible scenario you should only need 5 at most.~~ I just learned today that the ""*restore 20% HP immediately*"" only applies to the **caster** (the Mystic, it restores 20% of their health when they cast the skill to drop the mote). I just unlocked the Glyph and while the token for it states thusly, the actual description in the Skill window is vague and leaves out the ""*caster's*"" clarifier.  Regardless, chain-devouring 12 in a row makes you stupid and bad and basically just crippled the group's potential to deal with future damage.

6. A Priest's Restorative Burst (the skill that leaves the puddle on the ground) effect applies only ONCE when you make contact with the circle. For this reason, **there is no point for anyone to remain inside the circle**. Just touch 'n' go to get the over-time heal and mana restore (if Glyphed, and it should be at 65). A good Priest will place this on the melee group in harder dungeons, a great one will place it so one edge touches the melee group, allowing nearby ranged classes to dip in-and-out of the other edge.

7. Resurrect has a COOLDOWN (20 seconds, 10 seconds Glyphed but I personally do not use that Glyph), and costs A LOT of mana. If you see someone else in the group get resurrected before you, do not start bitching. We SEE you are dead, we chose someone else because they were closer or were a priority (another support, the tank, or someone who can kite while we attend to others). If you died underneath a pile of mobs or somewhere far from the fight, a simple ""I'm over here,"" will suffice. You can type more if you like. You are dead. You are not going anywhere.

8. Just because we cast Resurrect on you does not mean it is safe for you to pop up at that time. It meant it was safe for US to give you the OPTION to resurrect. See above for what it costs to resurrect someone. Keep your eyes on the boss, and accept when it is clear. If you do, you will likely get healed to full a lot sooner.

8. Just because we can AoE heal the raid the entire time, does not mean we should have to. Reducing your damage taken means we can focus on keeping up buffs and debuffs and make the run go smoother overall. Your job is to deal damage, not take it unless it is unavoidable. Taking damage intentionally for the sake of a few extra hits means you are neglecting your job to shove more responsibility onto your support. I play some DPS classes too, and I play cautiously, perhaps too cautiously, but at the very least I avoid the damage I can."

"I was out in Jackson, Wyoming doing some back country hiking for the first time, it had snowed about 3 feet overnight so it was fresh pow everywhere. I rip down in this deep snow for the first time ever and about 20 seconds into what I thought was the most epic day of my life I didn't lean back enough and dug the nose of my board as deep as possible into the mountain/snow/earth and just stopped completely and flew forward and ragdolled into the abyss, then had to hike out like a sucker.

I also was a semi-pro skateboarder for a few years, never broke anything doing that either however playing baseball in College my shortstop was 100% deaf and it was a pop fly on my side of the infield (I played second base) I called him off, of course he didn't hear me, we connected shin bones and he had about 25 pounds on me, snapped my shin and put me in a full leg cast for 5 months, fun times. I hung onto the ball like a boss however for the finale out of a meaningless game in a pleasant 110 degree afternoon out in Texas."

"I was in a movie theatre with my friend Michael and his twin brother Todd and Todd's girlfriend Sarah. We were watching a murder mystery type movie. The place was packed. In one of the scenes, we see a 7yo girl in a ditch who's been raped and murdered.

So while the camera was slowly panning over the dead girl's body, Michael decides it's a good time to cut a fart. He then proceeds to quietly mumble to himself ""Huh"", as if it was the first time he ever produced a fart in his life. I am not a fan of toilet humour whatsoever, but his genuine surprise towards his flatulence got us both bent over laughing uncontrollably for what seemed like an eternity. Todd sniggered a bit and Sarah just silently glared at the three of us in disbelief.

Suffice to say, I don't think I ever wanted to know who the murderer was so quickly in my life.

"Like I said, it fundamentally has to be done out of the box before the Play Store is a viable update channel - which is of course a good part of the reason why Google insists so many GApps be preloaded. I consider Play Movies, Music, Newstand, et al to be bloatware. 

We've seen HTC, Sony, Moto, LG, and Samsung do this in places, so I suspect and hope it will increase.

A unified vanilla Android image with no preloaded apps would not take full advantage of the hardware and could not have real value added through the Play Store. It would also be dull. IMO."

"First of all, lentils are not bland. I'm going to ignore that slight towards my granulatory God and continue anyway.

Spices are a must to enhance the already delicious creamy texture of a well-cooked lentil. Garlic, ginger, cumin, turmeric, hot peppers, and cilantro are all very good in them.

One of my favorite dishes is spicy red lentil soup. Start with some garlic and yellow onions. Once they're sauteed, pour in your chosen amount of lentils. I recommend at least 2 pounds. Then add in twice as much water, wait for it all to boil, and simmer for a long time as you add in all the aforementioned spices. Really go for it with the turmeric too, it gives it a great color. I like to also add some tomatoes, celery, and fresh cilantro on top as a garnish, but this is all optional.

Serve over rice!"

"Unfortunately I have suffered from the same displeasure. To be fair, in real trucks, gear skipping is a thing. Unless you have an extremely heavy load, you won't be going 1-2-3-4 etc. I went back and forth a long time between using all three types of H-Shifter layout.

For a long time I used the default Range-Splitter, which acts most closely to how real Scania shifters work, with that 1-3-5 in the first range, then 7-9-11, and the other toggle switching to evens. I liked using this for 12 speeds because it still gave that feel of shifting to higher gears, but not having to skip gears as much (well ofc you're skipping the evens, but that's not the point).

I more recently went back to the generic range tran. I don't like using the splitter because, as you said, it's then just a 6 gear truck.

As for your question about trailer weight, yes. I use Jazzycat's mods, and haul those (or the Heavy Haul DLC trailers) almost elusively. I both find those trailers more fun (I like turning on the beacons and feel important. Sometimes I take two lanes like I have a police escort) and, because they are heavier, they provide a more fun shifting experience as well. I also sort my cargo by weight when looking for a job.

~~I will do a little research and perhaps attempt a mod to edit the gear ranges, but I am hesitant of the capabilities. I fear it may very well be tied to sometime else I can't control.~~ **See other comment**

Edit: You could also try hauling [bricks](https://i.imgur.com/fGuUVMH.jpg) :P

"Playing from behind on Riven can be very difficult and frustrating. One tip I'd suggest if you're behind on Riven, is to just play as a split pusher and put pressure on the map for your team since you won't be able to do much in teamfights anyways. Play safe and don't overextend; ward so you don't get caught split pushing a side lane. The enemy team will be forced to send at least one back to stop you from pushing and if you have TP, this creates a numbers advantage for your team. Just keep on split pushing a side lane until you're farmed and caught up in items so you can start being a factor in teamfights.

For laning phase, just remember that it's not worth taking a lot of harass for 2-3 minions. Just wait for the enemy laner to push the wave into your turret so you can safely farm. If the enemy laner freezes the lane, he's not putting pressure on the map, so you're free to roam. Use this time to roam and put pressure elsewhere on the map and help you get back into the game.

If Schweinsteiger starts against Brugge, we could see Herrera starting as well."

I think the biggest misconception about asexuality (after thinking that asexuality equals impotence, which it doesn't) is that it leaves a huge void in peoples lives. You are not missing anything, because there is nothing to miss - sex is not some integral and irreplaceable part of you, it's just - sex. There might be some incompatibilities with society, as such any problems come from outside rather than from inside you - I guess I could put it that way. And everyone has conflicts with other people, each of us their own.

I do kind of shy away from relationships because the thought that I could not satisfy the desires of my partner is discouraging. I focus on both enjoying my life and making my career/money. Eventually I want to create a family because I want a child, and maybe in my late 30s or so it is easier to find a partner who somewhat shares my sentiments and whose libido is not a core part of their life-satisfaction. That said I have not fallen in love since my early teens so I wouldn't know what I would do if I was put on the spot again."

I know I have every right to check and want to protect myself, but sometimes the customer says something (99% the money is legit) and try to make me feel uncomfortable for ""not trusting"" them.

"A good pair of blue jeans that fit, a nice belt, and either a t-shirt or a solid color button up. It's a nice, solid outfit that looks good on almost everybody.

As for general tips:

1. Know your size- A lot of guys buy clothes that are too big because they think that fitted clothes are uncomfortable when this is not the case. If you know what your clothing sizes are, like most adult men should, then you can go into most any clothing store and find some nice fitted clothing.

2. Know your body type- A lot of bulkier guys do not like wearing fitted clothing because they feel self-conscious about how it will make them look. If you need advice on that, look towards the bulkier football players in the NFL or the actor that plays Cameron from Modern Family. A bulkier guy can look REALLY good in a nice suit that fits him.

3. Try some color- Personally, I like to wear some basic blue Levi jeans with a basic, solid colored t-shirt. It's my basic go to look that can be nice and casual, or if I throw on a long sleeve button up over it I have a nice bit of colorful flair to a semi-formal look."

I really enjoy it
"I don't think we are any different from anything else that exists in the world apart from our sentience, and I don't think our creation is uniquely divine where the creation of a planet or a tree or a hydrogen atom is not. Inside the universe, in the world we can observe, everything has a natural cause. To deny that would be idiotic. I'm not arguing for a God that shapes man out of clay and breathes life into him, but an idea of God that explains why there is something rather than nothing. The universe exists, and something likely caused the universe to exist, and if that something wasn't God, then something caused that, etc. etc. but why is there an order that allows ""existence"" to be possible at all? Maybe there is a causal loop or something, but no matter what it is, from my perspective, the only conclusion is that, on some level beyond the universe, causality as we understand it does not exist. Once you get down to that realization, all bets are off as to what ""natural causes"" even are.

And as for the nature of God, I don't think it necessarily has to be like that. God could be an organizing principle and not a being at all, for instance. The idea of God as a cosmic Santa Claus is unsettling, but that's far from the only alternative to a purposeless universe."

"Yup. I stayed and battened down the hatches cause I knew it would be a shit show on the road.  My office had people stuck out there for so long they just walked home and left their cars there to pick up later at an impound. The most recent heavy rains turned my entire area into a god damn lake with whatever the fuck that comes out of the sewers these days everywhere.  Since all the electricity went out and the city refused to put up rain gauge warnings for my neighborhood, I sat out in the rain with some LEDs warning people off. Couple of idiots disregarded my warnings and drove on anyways only to have their cars ruined instantly with water damage. 

Make no mistake, Houston is completely ill-prepared for any sort of major disaster at this point and even more so with the city infrastructure in need of desperate repair. All they do is keep building out more toll roads and spreading the fucking city out into Katy, Bridgeland/Cypress and whatever is out past that fuckfest 99 toll road area is.  With road systems in need of desperate repairs but critical funding shortfalls, evacuation will only become more hazardous.  Add in the aging waterways and power systems you have all the signs of a city that can get knocked out by a major environmental event fairly quickly.  "

"The rebel flag that we all know of was the battle flag of a North Carolina company during the civil war. By the vast majority of people who actually use the flag use it to honor the soldiers in the war because believe it or not most soldiers don't care about the politics, they're just defending their home. 

The flag has, to the majority of southerns, just morphed into a symbol of the south and most southern people don't think of the civil war or slavery or racism, just the things they like about home when they see the flag. 

Believe it or not, being hateful about the south and ignoring the things that are good in it literally does nothing but feed your own ego. It just offends southerns and makes you look like a hateful fool to most other people. 

The south has its faults. Everywhere, has its faults. The cities with the most gang violence and murders aren't southern States. New York City and Chicago both have fairly well known ghettos. Because racism exists everywhere in the USA, some places are just more quiet about it and it isn't part of their stereotype. "
"As others have said, this article is extremely misleading. First, this only applies to Windows Server Update Services (WSUS), an on-premise (i.e. internal to a company's network) version of Windows Update that allows IT pros to control and manage updates on a bunch of machines without having to go out and talk to the internet/Windows Update. 

Then, it relies completely on the fact that WSUS servers use unencrypted HTTP by default. If the WSUS server was set up to use SSL, this can't be done. If I had to guess, the defaults are set that way because it's hard to a full on-premise SSL solution, but it's probably well-documented that not changing the defaults is insecure."

"One note on double-dipping: if you take Ultimate Evolution (where you clone another hero), you stop soaking XP in the location where you were.

This is because your body disappears from the pre-UE location, and you create a new Hero at someone else’s location.

UE is mostly a teamfight Ult, with some push potential if you have an advantage and clone someone like Sylv or Gaz or Zag).

Also! The UE-body-removing part means no double-dipping XP, *but* it does mean that UE doubles as an escape if your Z-burrow is on cooldown."

Worth nothing is that taking a brake actually does more harm than good as it will weaken the already weak muscles even further.

"Well I suppose people prefer when submissions are creative. Simply taking a gif and applying a filter over it takes practically zero creative thought. Even if OP took a lot of time to do this, spending time and effort on a submission so dull and generic-looking is kind of a waste. This is likely why people are downvoting. This is the real world, and praising people for simply ""trying"" often causes more harm than it does good."

"I beat the game two times, I have legit copy on PS3 and I pirated it to see how it goes for PC. I can't play on PS3 after seeing how sooth the PC version is, so  for online I decided to go with PC. There is minimal interest for me in SP, I am mostly interested in GTAO.

My question is, will I be able to play GTAO with shitty internet and is it actually worth it (whole experience, in the state that it is assuming my bad internet connection)? I hear a lot of people curse RS and MM so I wasn't sure if it is worth for me to spend the money only on GTAO without knowing for sure.

&gt; I don't think Sony operates their own game servers, at least for PS3 games, so I think you're dealing with R* servers on both, and I think all Social Club servers are owned/operated by R*.

You are correct which is why I booted PS3 to see how it will perform through VPN and I am yet to find some people, I've seen a dude on the tutorial mission and that's about it :(

To simplify, I have super shit internet with high latency will I be able to have fun racing in GTAO or will I end up being frustrated?"

Garp + Marco, Alvida, Mirage Tempo Nami, GP Usopp.

Either of the above two can be tweaked, I think there are some variations that will also work (the two Usopps may be more or less interchangeable, Mihawk can probably be swapped in over Coby or Alvida, etc.), but you'd have to do the math."

That's not even a friend, that's just using someone completely for sex. And yes, I have seen this play out several times in real life and yes these are usually dysfunctional relationships in general. He's obviously lacking in empathy, is self centered, and probably is superficial if he thinks he's going to upgrade to an arbitrary list of goals condensed into a woman.

"It should decay to ~25% health, at which it becomes claimable. It would continue decaying until it breaks (would take ~14 days time, so there is a 3.5 day window where it can be claimed). The decay curve could be adjusted so repairs don't have to be done daily to maintain best defensive. Very little to no decay over the first 7 days, linear decay to 0 the last 7 days.

You still would need to invest resources to repair it up when you take it over.

That... boy is the second most distressing thing I have ever seen in my entire life. First being how I once saw a miner literally cough up a piece of his lung.

I tip my imaginary hat. I smile at him. I force myself to look into his eye - only one on each side - and to see the terrified little outcast behind his appearance. The little boy who had carved out a tiny hole in his world for himself. A place to hide. A place of safety and order and regularity. A place where he could even excel and aspire to newfound heights.

""I heard you were the best stable caretaker for a hundred miles around,"" I tell him. This time my smile is genuine. ""People talk about you, you know.""

In all these discussions about developers you are forgetting about the users.

It may surprise you that Firefox is used not only by developers but also by people that want to view and interact with web sites in ways that are convenient to them.

The reason that I use Firefox -- the ONLY reason -- is because it has several extensions that simplify my online life.  Many of these extensions are no longer actively developed or supported, likely because the people that wrote them did not consider life-long maintenance to be their calling, but they still work and do what I need them to do.

The ongoing changes to Firefox feel like they are motivated by a desire to force the users to use the Web as Mozilla envisions and not as they want or need to.  First we got Australis shoved down our throats and only Classic Theme Restorer managed to somehow mitigate that disaster (by the way, the fact that it is currently the highest rated extension on AMO with a number of daily users approaching half a million, should tell you something), now we have forced signing (but at least I will be able to use the unbranded version) and soon you'll break most of the extensions that still keep me on Firefox by killing XUL.

When that happens, what reason will I have to continue using a browser that does not do what I want it to do?
Moreover, what reason will I have to stick with a browser that insists on repeatedly breaking the way I use it and forcing me to spend time, effort and frustration on retraining myself only to go through the same process again and again?

I used to recommend Firefox to everyone.  Hell, I used to advocate it and actively try to persuade people to switch to it.  I don't do that anymore, and when asked just say ""just use chrome, it works and it's predictable"".

"It seems to me that modern American Conservatism is mainly a child of the cold war, and defines itself as being the opposite of everything the Soviet Union stood for. USSR was atheist? We will be Christian! USSR had a government run economy? We will have free enterprise! USSR was a threat to US foreign interests? We will promote an aggressive foreign policy to counteract that!

The problem is that all three of those things are in disagreement with each other. Christians preach against greed and violence. Free enterprise proponents dislike both the tax breaks that the church gets and the high cost of foreign wars. And war hawks don't really give a shit about any other higher ideals aside from projecting their power over others.

So now that the USSR is gone, the right wing is looking increasingly incoherent and is desperately trying to construct a reason why its supporters should stick together in spite of their differences. And so far they've done a remarkably good job of selling this bizarre ideology to the faithful, but to an outsider it doesn't seem to make any sense whatsoever.

&gt;If you're sick, hurt, or injured you should be getting help and/or advice somewhere else - preferably from a doctor. While people in Fittit might have similar conditions as you, not a single person will be able to examine you personally or understand your specific situation, and it's very hard to validate credentials over the internet. You should instead find a professional with proper schooling and experience who can examine and treat you in person. General Practitioners might not be the best for sports-related issues, so it is recommended that you find a Sports Medicine doctor or a Physical Therapist.

&gt;Prohibited topics include, but are not limited to: training advice with a known medical condition; training advice specifically involving an injured body part; and ""general experience"" posts asking about other people's experiences with a particular injury.  Posts on these topics are considered requests for medical/injury advice and are not allowed.  Posts seeking training advice that *excludes* an injured body part are allowed.

"One of the things you want to do with younger kids is really just let them play what they want and do the crazy stuff they can imagine. They'll like to have a lot of combat, and you don't want it too complicated. I usually find that the best way to play with kids is to focus on there being some kind of simple, completable goal (like retrieve an artifact, or beat the bad guy), and then you want to populate their way with interesting villains for them to defeat (goblins are a great start) and introduce some simple, but solvable puzzles (the bridge is out!). 

Kids aren't really great at role-playing, but they are great at coming up with ways for their characters to kick a lot of ass, and that's really what the focus should be on. You want things to be pretty tightly-paced, and varied. Throw in pirates, or dinosaurs, and use monsters that they'd know and understand before reaching deeper into the Monster Manual. Zombies are an excellent monster type, as are goblins, orcs, yetis, etc. 

You'll also want to get a few pregens ready to go, and you can always cut down the clutter on the character sheets by avoiding telling them everything they need to know about stat blocks and just give them the numbers they'll need to hit things: +5 with the sword, 1d8+3 damage, etc. You'll also want to try to keep the game pretty short. We may love sitting and playing for hours, but the perfect game for kids will mean an adventure that might take maybe an hour to complete. 

As with all things D&amp;D, being able to weave cool effects into your players' tale is the total highlight of being the DM. If a bad guy fails his combat check, or fails to climb a hill, or anything of the sort, describe how comical it looks, or how the characters heroically deflect a pirate's cutlass with his shield. Also allow your players the opportunity to describe how something looks when they do something right: if one of your players kills a goblin, ask them to describe their finishing blow! Use their ideas and improvise. The most memorable parts of the game will be the moments when your players will decide how heroic they look as they march to victory, and you want to reward them for their cleverness."

That's actually exactly what the movie shows. At the end of RotJ, after Vader is dead and burned on his funeral pyre, he shows up as a force ghost on Endor during the celebration. What seemed more to be the issue was Sith dying as Sith and becoming force ghosts.

It was pretty much established canon at that point that Revan was a Jedi, had an encounter with the Emperor and was under his control as a Sith, then defeated and redeemed as a Jedi. In the book and in SWTOR he was very much still a Jedi and mostly light-leaning before his defeat in the Foundry.

"It's not even a contest. 

All the Arkham-verse versions of the Bat Fam are basically one-man-armies; it would be over before it even really got started. 

Nolan-verse Batman is good fighter but he'd probably be better off facing Batgirl without his armor than he would be facing her as Batman.  

The Nolan armor—whether its Begins or Knight—has a fair share of flaws, and both versions seem to substantially restrict Batman’s maneuverability; heck, in Begins they actually make it in-universe canon that *he couldn’t turn his head*.  

Batgirl’s got speed, maneuverability, superior armor design, and most importantly? She’s a better fighter. 
The Bat-fam in Arkham Verse have almost preternatural situational awareness and they all perform combat maneuvers, in full combat armor, that are remarkably dexterous and agile. 

Nolan-Bats has a repeated issue if not minding his surroundings and, due to the restrictive nature of his armor, is heavily reliant on grapples, blocks, and very close range fighting.  

Assuming they’re both in character then Batgirl encounters an alternate universe Batman and for some reason has to incapacitate him. She knows he’s not a bad guy so she doesn’t want to hurt him anymore than she has to… So all she needs to do is out maneuver him. Take a page of Muhammed Ali’s book and just dance around him, making him come to her, forcing him to wear himself out, and when he’s tired she puts him down.

If they're out of character and going for blood then she can just cut loose and hammer him senseless. She's got greater speed, flexibility, better armaments, and she's hyper-aware to the world around her, using it to her advantage whenever possible. She'd crush him.

Reporter Carl Bernstein and others have questioned why Clinton would have voted against the Levin Amendment, which would have required President Bush to allow more time to UN weapons inspectors and also would have required a separate Congressional authorization to allow a unilateral invasion of Iraq, if her vote was simply a vote for strong diplomacy.""

I don't care about her admissions. Clinton will go along with whatever will get her elected, and for that reason, she could very well come out in defense of her vote in Iraq if the polls dictated it.

"Contrary to what you often see in movies and on TV, CPR very rarely ""revives"" the victim and that is not what it is for. CPR is intended to keep oxygenated blood flowing to the heart and brain until the heart can be defibrillated with an electric shock.

If someone has lost a lot of blood, it may or may not be a good idea to perform CPR. This is a situation where you would definitely want someone with medical experience guiding you."

"When who erases our memories? At the moment we don't really know enough about the brain to *intentionally* remove memories from one without also causing severe damage to other systems.

But if we're talking in terms of accidental memory loss (from head trauma, etc) then it's very common for one to lose more than just memory -- challenges interpreting or experiencing emotions or the loss of linguistic abilities are also common in cases of severe head trauma. So I guess the answer to your question is ""We do!"".

Generally speaking, retrograde amnesia (the loss of one's existing memories) is actually relatively rare, and sometimes it's even temporary. What's far more common (from my reading, at least) is anterograde amnesia, which is when the mind loses the ability for form *new* long-term memories. But in either case, loss of language skills isn't at all rare, just less widely featured in media. Memory loss stories are common in a lot of fiction, especially science fiction (and soap operas). In such stories, it would usually be far too inconvenient for a character to lose their memories AND their ability to participate in dialogue."

&gt; Well, while I'm not sure a salad-spinner for menstrual pads really makes a difference, menstrual cups replace tampons and cloth pads replace disposable pads. They're not interchangeable, although some charities do also provide reusable menstrual cups.

&gt; Cloth pads can be hung in the sun to dry, where a menstrual cup should be at least periodically sterilized with boiling water (which creates issues like access to boiling water, stigma about taking out a menstrual device in front of family, etc.) There may be stigma against unmarried women or virgins using vaginal devices (and in countries where the more severe forms of FGM are prevalent, impossible.) 

&gt; Some women and girls may never be able to comfortably use menstrual cups, or may need to try different menstrual cups which is a financial barrier. The learning curve is higher. Using menstrual cups may increase the risk of infection if the girls or women don't have the means to wash their hands with soap and clean water before putting their fingers in their vaginas.

&gt; Menstrual cups also don't provide protection for things like incontinence, spotting between periods, or post-partum.

&gt; Menstrual cups serve a purpose and have many benefits, but they're not interchangeable with cloth pads.

I use cloth pads, and personally think this is a silly idea done by art students who don't understand the problem. There's a [lot of charities]

 * Not use ""faggot"" ourselves, and keep being called faggot by other people.

I'm sorry, but I don't see why the second option is any better than the first? We're getting a word forced on us either way, and if that's happening I'd rather not be complicit in this out of a false sense that this somehow improves the situation.

Besides that, I don't even believe your premise that African Americans 'taking ownership' of the N word has actually reduced other people's use of the word. I mean the word isn't any less hurtful now than it was 50 years ago, and racists aren't confused about this fact -- they use the N word in a disparaging way even today. What did change is that it became less socially acceptable to be racist. In a few decades it will be less socially acceptable to be homophobic and disparaging use of the F word will similarly be reduced, but not gone. I don't see how us using the word in a 'positive' way would accelerate this process."

"This is one of the reasons that all officers and cadets should be pulled from enlisted personnel, and the age of enlistment needs to be raised to 21 or higher. These academy officers are out of touch with reality, they leave normal society at 18 and never have anybody that can stand up to them for the remainder of their lives. Experienced soldiers have no influence over them, and so doctrine becomes almost cartoonish. 

Consider the difference between wars led by academy graduates and those lead by actual experienced soldiers like Colin Powell. The results are dramatically different. 

They need to stop teaching this BS and isolating their leadership from the real world. The last general to have been enlisted, NCO, and officer was Now retired Marine Corps General Oster. You may know him as the last head of Marine Corps development to produce anything successful. "

Should I reconsider? I really like ThirdEye on it, actually, and I have no complaints otherwise.

"I'd be glad to hear it from someone else.

I guess there's three main reasons I tell people.

1. I think that knowing what other people thought about you can make your past more understandable.   
2. Sometimes when I tell them that I had a crush on them, they tell me that they felt the same. This then helps me understand the past as well. Maybe in the future we won't make the same mistakes with whomever our feelings reside in.  
3. I think it is respectful to my past self. If I have a crush on someone but choose not to tell them, it usually means that I care very deeply for them and don't think that they would be happy if we were together. I tend to obsess over people, so they become such a large part of my life for a period of time, that I no longer feel like the same person once I stop caring about them. By telling them that I once cared for them, it is choosing to not discredit the things I once felt and the person I once was.

"The most boring girl I ever went on a date with had these traits:

1) No passion or wit in conversation.  Didn't make me laugh or illicit any meaningful conversation between us.

2) Had hobbies, but was very surface level in all of them.  She had an art degree and made art as a second income, but her art was not impressive.  Not bad at all, just not impressive.  That's kind of an asshole thing to say but it was true.  She liked running, but her idea of that was running around the block a couple times.  She liked video games, but only played COD.

3)  Not many long term goals.  I know many of us are just guessing and making our way as best we can.  She was in a tough place, working minimum wage at an art supply store at 27 with an art degree.  She didn't know what to do, whether to move out of the area, move back home, go back to school...etc"

"I see no conflict -- at all -- with modern science and most forms of modern Christian theology.

These thought experiments always seem very dated to me, like early 20th century material. Back then, scientific literacy -- and literacy in general -- were not as widespread. 

Most educated Christians have no issue at all with science, and most non-reactionary scientists spend little time thinking about how they're going to reconcile/attack/etc. new theories with existing religious beliefs.

There's just no issue here. "

Again, your comments are great, you should write screenplays or novels with this ability of storytelling. I'd rather rely on scientific data.

And Transistor has one of the best soundtracks I've seen in a game in ages. It's very ethereal but also more modern than the others I mentioned. My favorite track here is ""In  Circles"". This is the only one out of the three I've mentioned that contains songs with lyrics, but only roughly 4 or 5 of the tracks have lyrics, the rest do not. "

Edit: for one, Kangaroos are all about avoiding humans. You would have to corner one to be attacked. Bears generally don't fear humans at all, and can have a pretty much ""fuck you"" attitude, and come right after you. And they're fast, way faster than you think those big fat fucks could be...

They were pretty good traders and even better warriors, they'd like to prove which one of them was best by seeing who could kill the most guys in battle, plunder the most loot, that sort of thing. Long story short, a bunch of them got shipwrecked on Vale after a storm, they went inland to find materials for some new ships, got lost for a while and thought 'Screw it, this is where we live now.'"" *After finishing, she leans back into her chair and assumes her previous position.* ""So there you have it, the story of my people, not a particularly good story mind you, but it's something at least. I don't know, maybe I'm just a bad storyteller."" *She says with a shrug.*

""As for my father, well, you couldn't get anything past him. I'd sometimes try and sneak out whilst he was out on patrol and cause mischief, but he'd always know exactly what I did, down to the last detail. He was pretty good like that, I always used to pester him to let me train with him and become a guard. Then one day, he just tossed me a weapon, said 'Show me what you got.' and my training began, just like that."" *She says with a nostalgic smile on her face.

"the main criticism I heard from some of the pro players I've spoken to about it was that they couldn't crack the format. it was sufficiently deep that nobody really figured out the optimal strategy for drafting in the short amount of time the set was legal (it was a third set in the block with a summer core set release coming up behind it). 

from a pro player point-of-view, that is a serious downside. they are trying to get competitive advantage as rapidly as possible and come up with a strategy that produces more wins than losses, and do it before their competition figures it out. they weren't able to do that, and felt frustrated. these are the same reasons non-pro players praise the set. it is deep and nobody really completely figured it out, which is a lot of fun for most players, but a big let down for extremely competitive players focusing on their match winning record.

Your analogy is crap, since no one has a sign on their house saying ""don't run into my house"".

Here's a better analogy:

""we have video of you running a stop sign at Maple and Elm on April 3rd.""

""Wait, there's no stop sign in that video"".

""That's right, because we just decided put one there in June.""

EDIT: BTW, since Trey Gowdy has had Clinton's emails for months now, has he been keeping them on a classified server?  Since they are retroactively classified now...

"Your argument will inevitably lead to the ""Tragedy of the Commons"" as your splattery mess of overpowered WiFi will immediately and negatively impact anyone within range.

There are good reasons for cars to temporarily exceed the speed limit and email has legitimate use. Your WiFi doesn't compare to this as there is literally no way for you to muck with it that doesn't negatively impact something.

Upping your transmit power to beyond the legal limit overdrives the amplifier and degrades not only your experience but the experience of anyone within range.

Changing your frequency outside what WiFi is supposed to be using leads to clipped splattery signals and may interfere with licensed equipment in another band.

If you absolutely require more range or unflooded frequencies then you can move to a licensed band and buy licensed equipment.

I have so many mini lipsticks that I am hopeful I will be able to finish at least one by Christmas. Also, I have several other eyeshadows that are also close to hitting pan, so I will be satisfied if I can hit pan on at least one of those, I just didn't want to specifically choose one. I don't have pictures right now, but I do plan on adding them during the updates!

"For the reverse, you mostly need to file taxes in the US, or go to a select few places - TD and RBC's US arms being two, credit unions being the other.

If you JUST want to spend US money in Canada, you can get one of the many US credit cards with no foreign transaction fee. VISA or MasterCard have the widest acceptance. For easy, the CapOne Quicksilver is good. For more complex, well, see /r/churning

If you really want a Canadian bank account, try the credit unions in the province you visit most, or give RBC Bank (the US arm of RBC) a call and see if they do the reverse - RBC Bank is usually for Canadian snowbirds.

Oh yeah, one more option - HSBC Premier, if you can put $100k with them (investments, mortgages, whatever)."

Ul'dah is the easiest to get around, the city quests / clicking Aetherytes take the shortest amount of time, and the 1-15 quest experience in Thanalan IMO is way more efficient than everywhere else.

The main benefit to Limsa is you can get to the marketboards quickly (Ul'dah requires a loading screen from the nearest Aetheryte, which sucks.)"

If you quit, you get no severance (although you won't anyway in this scenario), you also can't claim Unemployment (in most cases.) By quitting, you're just helping them.

Can you really blame him for conveying an anti-front office message?  It sends a really bad message to the younger players when you cut your players for crap like that.

Plus it kinda suggests to the players that the front office doesn't give a crap about winning. Jeff Baker was a serviceable utility guy, who definitely would be a better option than Rojas. Plus he would have given us some pinch hitting depth. "

I visited it this summer and there were people from all walks of life enjoying the walk and views. In the winter when there is snow, it is less crowded, but still enjoyed. I fear a High Line type park in Seattle would be run over with homeless people and drug users, not well kept because of a lack of volunteers or lack of buy in from the city/Seattle Parks. When it rains, there would be very few people up there. We don't have NYC's population or tourist influx and if it has a poor reputation among locals, the community won't work to protect it.

Farming: Last hit with Q and autos early game, barrels are only to be used for zoning. They take so long to arm before 7 that its hard to time them, and they don't do enough to one shot the casters until you get a sheen/avarice crit.


Ranged: Sorry man, every time I've gone against a ranged I don't do well, here you max range farm with q, hide in bush, and pop out for last hits, or if its a squishy teemo, you can place a defensive barrel, and chain them to him, run at him, w the blind, auto for passive, and run out. That wins trades with teemo starting about level 4. Vlad is just like, unwinnable solo.


Tanks: The problem here is armor, triforce &gt; IE and barrels kind of shit on non 3 armor item tanks, so if you farm up till sheen, zoning with the threat of barrel you should be good. When you get sheen you can either power farm and try to carry, or go for the chunk/kills by putting a barrel on your melees and just waiting."

"Yeah I mean that's the other thing...1-2 gallons looks like absolutely nothing once it's poured into a sink. It's not nearly enough water to dump soap into and be able to submerge the dishes enough to wash them.

Think about how little your sink would fill up if you plugged the drain and dumped out a 2L pop bottle into it. The water would be like an inch high. That's 0.5 gallons."

"Puma is another name for a mountain lion. They are native to North America. They also go by catamount, cougar, and sometimes panther (but that's stupid since that cat already exists).  As far as I know, they're the only ""big cat"" native to North America."

"Anyone who keeps up on current hardware can maybe answer a question for me: I've kept my pc fairly up-to-date (i7 3770k, 16gb ram, 1000w psu, etc.) but the one thing that's starting to really lag behind is my GPU which is an xfx 6870. I know it's been my bottleneck a while and I've been meaning to ugprade but I'm in school right now and having trouble finding the funds to dedicate to a new gpu (not to mention the Canadian dollar problems.) I had planned to wait until I can afford something good but I'm getting really sick of this card so I may just give up and spend just a bit of money I don't have for something decent. 

My problem is since I haven't kept up on the recent generations, I'm unaware which cards would be a significant upgrade while still saving me some $. While the cards were still being named in order (5870, 6870, 7870, etc.) it was easy to tell where I sit or check comparisons to nvidia cards that way but with the new naming and comparison websites being dated when comparing old and new, I'm a bit lost. If anyone has some suggestions on some decent bang-for-your-buck cards, I'd really appreciate it. Thanks!"

"I installed ubuntu first just to see what is was on my laptop at the age of 10, the wireless did not work so I forgot about it. I was then later reintroduced to it because on of my friends linked me to r/unixporn, and so the archlinux phase started. I just turned 15 and now all of my computers run linux. 

I use it because it is fun to use. I like programming on linux and the customizeability of it. I don't like how gaming performance is lower because I am somewhat of an obsessed gamer."

"1. It's hard to say. I grew up with a somewhat normal life, so I was always pressured to have a girlfriend and lose my virginity like every other horny teenager out there. It wasn't until I grew out of the peer pressure phase (16-17) that I was able to sit down and think why I didn't look at females at the beach in a bikini... And why I was staring at the dog they were walking instead.

2. Very close friend of mine did, but that is because she's the one who introduced me to the porn in the first place! She liked looking at horse porn though. I'm more of a canine guy.

3. Other than that friend, I've tossed the idea of it with my mother, you know to test the waters. But she isn't the most nurturing type, so I didn't tell her that I was attracted to dogs.

4. I do want the normal life. I enjoy human company still, so hopefully I'll find someone, have a family, and keep that secret to my grave.

5. Gender fluid/neutral. 

Just kidding, dude with normal dude hobbies barring dog fuckery."

"I got on an online chat and the person reprovisioned both lines for me, so now dialing into voicemail gets me to two ""new"" mailboxes. I lost my messages as I had to set everything up from scratch, but all is good there. Thank you!

The second issue just might have been a tech issue this morning, as now I can send texts to that number and others and it seems to be okay. Strange that changing a plan would cause all of this. "
